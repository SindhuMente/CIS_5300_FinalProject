# CIS_5300_FinalProject

In order to use our models for milestones 2 & 3, first, create a shortcut from the 'CIS 5300 Project Folder' to 'My Drive'. After, simply click on the 'Runtime' tab and hit 'Run all.' You will be prompted to mount your Drive to the file; click accept. After, you will see the output of each cell, and the final ROUGE and BERTScore produced.

This is the link to the Drive where all of the code is located: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XFnjyEi8Db1EHnsone5HEDbm_ANE8WaW?usp=drive_link
