There is NO workaround for it.  Unless you go through the load balancer outside and it's real address. Craig|||John: Arun, Maybe in the short term, you can just test with http access. You may have to create a script that overwrites the /etc/hosts file with one that maps to a specific server box prior to running the automated test against a box.

Wow, this is really tough times.  Hopefully we can get through the bad times. To answer your questions: 1.  If you want to reference to the machine where the app is running, you should just use ""localhost"".  I think that would be the best way to go. 2.  For the switch statement, you can use value=""default"" in the tool.  Just use the word ""default"" as one of your values and assign it to any screen.  This should be your last value, very similar to that of c or c++.  It will server as a catch all. Hope this helps, and hope all is well.  Later.|||Werner: Hi Diana, I'm really glad to hear that you're still with the company ! Thanks for your reply, but I gave one more question regarding the IP address (I haven't described the problem clear enough in my previous mail): this is the scenario (we have to do 2 steps to get an image from the website to the device - this is due to the special design of this website): the application is started on a pocketpc; our application server (IPADDRESS) copies an image from the website to local disk space (this is done by an aml-script); then the pocketpc gets the image from here using e.g.: <img src=HTTP://LINK .... > so here I need the IP address of the application server, 'localhost' will not work here; is there a way to determine the IP-address of the application server ? Thanks again Werner|||Diana: Werner, I think you are talking about the KPMG project.  The aml script that you received saves the images to the local machine.  If the EMAS where the application is hosted and the webserver is on two different machine, the solution will not work.  You'll need to change the aml script such that it saves the image to the machine where the webserver is running.  In that case, you will know exactly what IP address to use in the application.  You can just hard code the IP address as the server address should not change often. I have attached the original java file for the aml script.  What you need to do is to make sure the path for the FileOutputStream is in the format ""HTTP://LINK  You would then reference the image using  ""HTTP://LINK This is the line you'll need to change: FileOutputStream outPut=new FileOutputStream(""/Netscape/Server4/docs/"" + s + "".gif""); Let me know if I have answered  your questions.|||Werner: Hi Diana, that answers my question, thanks a lot for your help !

HOLMultipleForm seems to be strange in output since the <select  comes before <form submission where the canon has <form tag first and that should be correct. Did you see this on SP8, probably not. thanks Miyuki|||Sharon: thanks Miyuki - the functional tests in English have been passing. You can check the canons for the English tests and see if they are similar to the Japanese tests - Also, you can check with RaviK about whether or not these tests have been updated recently - maybe there has been a recent change. thanks, sharon|||Miyuki: So, do you know if there are any changes in the recent patch. My functional test in Japanese failed, and two output on IE are the same between output folder and cannon, but the code is slightly different.  The third one seems to be strange. thanks Miyuki","Miyuki describes a functional test result to Sharon, asks about a failure, and describes some details.","Miyuki tells Sharon that everything is good for SP9 except the Form script of PDA.

Miyuki then tells Sharon that she has a functional test in Japanese that failed and that the second one is almost the same as the first but with slight differences."
39,"Subject: review of hp and sun contracts|||Robert: Shawn, I was talking with Kimberlie, and we thought that it is important for us be clear on how the HP and Sun contracts could impede each other.  For instance, we have agreed with HP that we would not offer our licensed product on HP UX any later than on another vendor's Unix or Linux (i.e., Sun Solaris).   That means that we need to port to HP UX before we can offer our licensed product with Sun.  There may be other items in the contract that would be important for Kimberlie to be clear on as well as how they could impact the product roadmap.  Kimberlie will be out for two weeks, but will be getting up to speed on the contracts.  When she comes back, I suggest that we walk through the contracts with her to highlight any potential problem area.  What do you think? - Robert|||Shawn: Sounds good. Lets do it on Monday. Please schedule it. We definitely need to get these terms cleared up as they could really hurt our ability to make sales especially in the case of Sun, since there is NO way that they will introduce AvocadoIT into ANY accounts if we do not run on Solaris. Thanks, Shawn|||David: Robert is out Mon - Wed.  The issue of Solaris / HP-UX should not be a problem since we had ""availability"" of Solaris b/4 we signed the contract. David|||Helen: By the time we get leads through the pipeline and ready to implement on Solaris we should have this figured out.  Getting leads into the pipeline with Sun should be priority number one.  They should not be waiting to start this process until the port is complete.  We should be addressing sales and port simultaneously.",Robert asks Shawn for feedback on a potential   issue between two companies they both have contracts. He adds Kimberlie is out but would like to talk with her when she is back as she knows more. Shawn agrees to a meeting and says this issue may be important. David says the issue may not be since something predates the contract. Helen says to prioritize and to address two issues simultaneously.,"A discussion is had regarding contracts with HP and Sun and the release of a licensed product. Robert wants to know what may impede the release of the licensed product. He suggests to Shawn that once Kimberlie returns, that they address this with her. Shawn agrees and suggests they meet on Monday. He also tells Robert he needs to hear this as it may affect sales. David says Robert is unavailable on Monday, but suggests it should not be a problem. Helen says that sales should be priority."

There are no simulators available today with command line options.  As a result we will have to write our own html browser for the HTML based devices. - Do we use the ICEbrowser for this ? - java based. - easier to integrate - cost (unknown, heard some high estimates, need to confirm) - use ICE browser for simulation and then later replace our IE browser with this as well.  Using ICE browser will make the relative URL java script problem a non issue. - One can use IE for simulation ? - this will require activeX and we will be introducing more C++ dependency. - more work than ICEbrowser If a long term goal is going to be make the EMDS completely java based then we might want to start migrating to ICE browser. RItesh would require a decision from me.  I am leaning towards ICE browser, if the cost is not too prohibitive.

I went and spoke after this with Ritesh and Tony after this. Tony suggested another option for the next release perhaps we'll just use IE from the command line.   This will not be a ""tight integration"" but it will serve the prupose.  It does appear that the user will eventually still want to use the actual emulators shipped by the device manufacturer's. We'll design the framework such that the user's can plug in their choice of emulators and if they can't be started from the command line, we'll make it easy for them to get the start URL.  Hopefully in the future they can be started from the command line. Thanks Srik|||Steve: Srik, Before you shut out this alternative, please tell me the price you think would be acceptable.

I don't see any deviceID with values of Null or Blank in the report (and I'm not sure what is displayed when a blank deviceID is passed), but wanted to make sure we aren't filtering out any actual usage because of the deviceID problem. Please let me know if this isn't clear (even sounds a little tricky to me). Thanks.

I don't feel confident that our filtering mechanism can tell the difference between garbage hits and real ones since deviceID being blank does not distinguish between the two.  Do you have knowledge on how any usage that does not show up in the reports is filtered out?

However, I am not clear on the cost front - (development, documentation, QA etc). Does the Cost that Praveen gave for development (25 days) cover the japanese install and the service pack install changes? Also, 4.0 release is quite different and may require significant changes in install - at which point we can plug in the the installer.

I'd like to get your input before I give you my perspective. Thanks, Dan.|||Peter: Is it something we can charge the partner for? I'm for whatever makes business sense i.e. Will it help move business thru or with the partner. It would probably help foster closer field relations with a partner. But I would not want to have an SE unavailable for weeks since their doing no billable work for a partner What's behind the question. I will be in my office tomorrow. Peter|||Dan: I'll call you tomorrow to chat further, but basically there used to be a group called Partner Solutions Group (PSG) that has been disbanded and is now part of Professional Services (PS). Also, Europe and Japan do not have a lot of PS support on site and are in very diff time zones so Sujan is asking about using SE's to do this (for now just in Europe). I've always felt that SE should do whatever it takes to win business. However, doing developer support is more of a post-sales activity. In the case of partners, SE has done some support (e.g. AC in VA). My main concern is the time-drain on SE and also the fact that an SE in general is not prepared to do full-blown developer support - that has typically been done by our in-house developers (AE).|||Peter: Dan, I misunderstood something. I thought you meant pre-sales developement work, i.e. building an ""off line"" prototype as part of a sales effort. I believe post sales should be handled almost exclusively by Sujan's group since the work should be paid for, or as a company we have decided to do some work for free for longer term gain - in which case Sujan should be give relief on his ""billability"" statistics.

Peter wants to know if we can charge the partner for the work   even if SE did the workwhy wouldn't the partner get charged. They are both saying Sujan group should handle the post sale support but Sujan is over loaded with billable work and the SE's can get the work done prior to the work of day so we do not leave to many bugs in the customer solution. So we need to decide if we will bill the partner for off peak development work.

Thanks, Ricardo|||Steve: Mike, Did we propose Premium service with dedicated servers to this customer? $4K sounds like Standard. Please confirm. Thanks, Steve|||Steve: Ricardo, Sorry for the delay. How do your hosting agreements specify things like time-out settings and other level of service terms? Settings that vary from application to application are not specified in the hosting agreement. This has more to do with functionality specific to the customer needs rather than a service level maintained for all applications. By default, if the timeout setting is different from any other application, it has to be placed on a standalone server. Five minutes is standard and should not be a problem on a shared server. If and when the customer wants to extend the timeout, the other applications will be considered and either inherit the setting or the app will be moved onto its own server. Because the customer has signed up for Standard service, eventhough the app may be hosted on its own server, the SLA is maintained at 95% for 12X5 coverage.|||Ricardo: Steve, No problem.

In the initial implementation OCA may not support predicates, but the language should include this. *	Insert operation is a kind of form submission operation. We need to define a workflow that automatically generates a form for insert, update, and delete operations. *	A suggestion for Sanajy - Can meta data be treated as an attribute of an element? This provides a uniform frame work for expressing a query using the predicate syntax of XPATH. --prasad",Mark updates everyone on language changes and asks Prasad for feedback.

Since USPS is a new project, let's set the proper procedures in place that we can apply to future projects. To solve this problem, I believe that we should perform the necessary switches on one or more of the global variables supported by the EMAS to distinguish the type of device that is requesting information from it.

Prasad does this overlap too much with other materials for next week - e.g. in the area of the file format changes.  I tried to focus on the changes in the context of Siebel Utilities and I think some overlap should be ok.  Or you can steal some slides if you like. The total time for this .ppt is probably only 1 hour.  However, I think for my TOI on Friday, here, I'll go over the chapter from the developers guide on the <SiebelUI> specification.  I could do something similar next week.  I think the 2 hour estimate should probably stand to allow plenty of time for questions. - Dave.|||Ravi: Dave, I have you for 2 hrs next week for training on Siebel utility and adapter. I hope this is enough. I just spoke to Prasad and he is going to be in the presentation. Ravi|||Ravi: Dave, Please workout with Prasad on what he needs to cover.

Ravi|||Dave: Yes, I had been thinking of working off the document for the <SiebelUI> specifics - I like the audience to know about the docs and using them in the talk seems like a good idea in that regard.  However,   I will take your suggestion and incorporate more of that into the PPT at the conceptual level. I'll also take a stab at describing the basic adapter processing and run it by Prasad.  Prasad, you are welcome to own any piece of this presentation if you like. I'm not planning to cover the file format or configuration changes generally, other than what is in the PPT I've already sent.  I'm assuming this is covered by other talks. - Dave.","Dave makes a list of new utilities and asks Srik for a review and Prasad for feedback on technical details.

146,"Subject: regarding to login failure message bug ... 3863|||Kant: Regarding to bug HTTP://LINK it will works in JDB adapter but it may not work for ActiveX adapter. For ActiveX interface, Siebel will return 4096 for invalid logon and also for other errors that maybe or may not be logon related.  Thus in ActiveX version of the adapter, adapter can't tell from the return code what 4096 really means and thus won't re-map the return code to 407 (map to 500 for generic server error). So if OCA looking for return code 407 then do a special process (correct Siebel return message is in packet level error), it may have different behaviors between ActiveX and JDB ... According to below e-mail, README.TXT already stated that user may experience different behavior between ActiveX and JDB ... just want to we all agree on this. Please also see HTTP://LINK for additional information.|||Rajeev: OCA does special things for 407 [An error code that is defined by the Offline subsystem .. not individual adaptors]. For 407 error OCA is not only displaying the error message returned by OSA/Adaptor But more importantly it is also reseting the Record status from uploaded_modified/inserted to modified/inserted state etc. For other error types the records will be set to Error state....a very painfull thing fo the end device user. I would highly recommend that the ActiveX adaptor put the appropriate hack to return an 407 error in case of login failure. Rajeev|||Keith: We will make ActiveX return 407 based on any exception from the login call. We'll need another build/installer. We'll let you know when. Keith|||Geoff: This has been done. It is worth pointing out that the bug was filed for *all* error messages, not just the login message.  The login message is critical, and has been addressed.  All other messages remain unaccesible from applications. We should fix this after 2/28.|||Sanjay: I agree with Rajeev. You're better off mapping all login failure messages to 407.","Kent explains the solution to the log in failure message bug will work in JDB adapter, but not in ActiveX because of the value the failure returns.  ActiveX doesn't know what to do when given the code. Rajeev suggests ActiveX use the appropriate hack to change the code to 407. Keith agrees and says they need another build/installer. Geoff reminds the group the bug was filled for all error messages and should be fixed after 2/28. Sanjay agrees and thinks all login failure messages should be mapped to 407.",Kant sends email about a bug that returns an error code that found to be 4096 in some conditions which isn't really a known error code. Rajeev recommends that the error code for the specific condition be set to a known error code such as 407 and gives reasons why. Keith says they will do it but need another build. Geoff says it will be done but that this won't fix all error messages. Sanjay agrees with Rajeev but its not logged because the email trail closed.

He said that the customer wants some revisions compared to the proposed DDS but Darshan has asked Rishi to try to push back with the customer since you two have completed development of the RIM app per the proposed DDS. Given that, I'm not too sure what other Fleet work you're involved with (possibly completing documentation for the PDA app). If you have some bandwidth on Tues, do either of you want to undertake writing a PRC file for a Palm application to effectively perform a ""please wait"" function so that the Palm gateway doesn't timeout the session if the customer's website is very slow.  Note, this is for a prospect demo for a company called Aviva that IDC has developed an application for. Would you please let me know if you have the bandwidth on Tues. & are interested in doing this.

156,"Subject: as 400 support?|||Bradley: Team, I have a potential customer, The Venetian in Las Vegas, who is very serious about going wireless. A budget and timeframe already exists, however they do not want to do any integration work. All of their data and communication resides within their mainframe (IBM AS 400/3270 dumb terminals). This information includes player status, statistics, room status, typical hotel and casino data. They want to deploy a variety of devices within the casino to access the mainframe. Simply put by the customer, if we do not support the AS 400 without any significant integration work than we're out. Would it be possible to build an adaptor specific for this type of traffic? Most casinos and hotels in Las Vegas operate with this infrastructure. Your thoughts and comments would be appreciated. Bradley|||Ricardo: Is the functionality they are looking to mobilize transactional or view only?|||Bradley: Both.  They need to be able to view data on specific players and customers.  Details are limited at this point. I need to know what are limitations are to date.  Regardless of the DB, what would it take for EP to interoperate with an AS400?  Is it possible to build an adaptor specific to this type of architecture?  If not, I need to bring in an SI, or better understand our EAI story.  This deal won't fly with any integration work. Bradley|||Ricardo: Brad, It looks like they need to view information, but no updates to the data store are required. Where the data is stored is independent of the architecture. If the information is stored on a JDBC compliant database, then we should be able to mobilize it through the JDBC connector available in 3.0. If it's stored in a proprietary data store, and a Java interface already exist, then we could mobilize it through the Java API available in 3.0. Else a Java or web-interface  will have to be built in order for us to mobilize it. I hope this helps, Ricardo|||Bradley: That sounds good.  I figured as much, thanks for taking the time this morning, see you tomorrow. Bradley","Bradley says that Venetian is a potential customer, but only if AvocadoIT can help them go wireless without any major integration work. Ricardo says that it looks like the Venetian just wants to view information without updating it. If the Venetian is using a JDBC compliant database, they can use the JDBC connector. If a Java interface already exists, they can use the Java API. Otherwise, they'll need a Java or web interface built in order to access the data. Bradley acknowledges that's what he expected.",Bradley says a potential customer says they need to operate the infrastructure of an AS 400 for them to come on board. This technology is foreign to Bradley. Ricardo says to use EP to link the AS 400 to 3.0 so the customer can view transactional data. Bradley says the customer can view transactional information and asks what it would take to link up EP with the AS 400.

Also Fidelity is targetted to have a RIM 950/957 Neomar browser 2.0.401 application ready soon (targetted for their review by Apr. 11).

Unfortunately, because we are running on an older 2.1 build, the report only contains a mobilized page hit count.  I will turn on web server logging which should provide additional information at a network and web level (using WebTrends).  However, we cannot deliver the application ""enhanced report format"" that was described in a previous e-mail.  I will see if there's anything else we can do with reporting. Regards, Richard|||Richard: Becky, Here are the options: 1. Upgrade the server software to 2.1.x The version of 2.1 ECS we are running does not support the detailed reporting described in my initial e-mail.  If we do decide to upgrade, there will be some regression testing but you won't need to upgrade the ERT software. 2. Upgrade the server software to 2.5 We discussed the issues associated with this migration.  The 2.5 version supports enhanced reporting. 3. Leave the server at the current version I turned on the standard web logging so we can provide a more detailed WebTrends report this week.  It still won't have the application level detail of option #1, but it provides good web access details (and the reports are ""pretty""). I would recommend that we stay with option #3.  Next week you can review whether the application page count and WebTrends report provide sufficient coverage for your current needs.

181,"Subject: bus dev|||George: david, just to be real clear. i know their is no disagreement the $12m bus dev commitment is for partner identified business. kraft is a partner deal. abn amro is not a partner deal|||David: George: I'd also like your agreement that where a partner adds significant value to EP closing a deal that we would not normally have gotten, then it should be considered a partner deal, as well.  Disney - identified by Grant, requires significant SI work, brought CGEY into picture because CGEY ""owns"" Disney - looks like a good combo.  In fact, there are going to be a lot of these type of cases.  In addition, I don't think an account is the way we want to count ""deals"", but really opportunities or specific projects within an account.  That's why we specifically put in the Prospect Registration Form.  Within any account, there could be many projects.  I wouldn't want to say categorically for example that ABM Amro is not a partner deal.  FedX is a very good example where Meltzer is working one opp and Accenture is bringing Meltzer into another. David|||George: we have had this conversation before and i still agree. i will pay on a per registered project and not a per client basis. with regard to bus dev helping on deals, that why you all have stock. in the case of close calls i hope you trust/respect me enough to know that i will do the right thing.  best regards  george|||Marie: George, Since Accenture and CGEY are expensive channels for us, I hope we are not involving them or relying on them unless they really are bringing value to opportunities that we can not close on ourselves. Marie|||David: I always trust you George. David|||David: Team: FYI ... I agree with George.  We need to make sure that the partners are bringing significant value to a deal, either by bringing us into the opportunity or, as in the case of USPS, really helping to close the deal.  As shareholders in the company, we certainly don't want to double pay for ""uncertain"" value. It also makes it imperative, that we understand, manage, and track partner opportunities appropriately.  I cannot emphasize this enough. Each of you should be responsible for really managing your partner opportunities.  There are too many instances where ""we"" brought them in, no ""we"" brought THEM in. Again, I'm asking for both Mitch's and Toni's great help in this area: to make sure that the info/projects are clear in Channelwave and the referring party is accurate. Thanks, everyone. David|||Mitch: Agreed,  I also think it is important to look at all opportunities we have and constantly evaluate where we need to engage a partner.  Not bringing them in just to bring them in, but to bring them in to win the business.  This week, we found out that there are projects going on in Sara, Bear Stearns and BofA that evolved independently of any partner introductions, even though partners had taken us in at other points in those companies.  At what point, if any, do we involve the partners in these opportunities?  In two instances (Sara, BofA), when I talked to the AM's they were not even aware we had partner connections in those accounts. I think ChannelWave will help all of you to see where we are engaged and to communicate with the AM to bring in the business. Mitch","George gives David specific examples of which deals should be counted as partner deals (Kraft) and which shouldn't (ABN Amro). David says that if closing a deal gives them access to a project they otherwise couldn't take on, it should count as a partner deal. He also says that pay should be per project, not per partner, and George agrees. Mitch and David both say that new partners should only be taken on if they provide lucrative projects.","David double-checks with George in a letter that partner deals involve identifying a deal that would not normally be obtained without a partner, suggesting that one should consider distinctions between different customer accounts. George confirms this framing and issues a policy of paying only on a per project basis, not per customer. George stipulates that some ambiguity will inevitably arise and that he will handle it with integrity. Marie wonders if it is wise to use Accenture and CGEY at points. David reassures George that he trusts him. David agrees with George and identifies an opportunity for change. Mitch agrees with the group and asks some important questions."

186,"Subject: error messages + log messages|||Srikanth: All I want to clarify our logging + error handling framework. We have two resource bundles (properties) - Logging infrastructure uses StudioLogResource (this is for localizing the log messages) Errors uses DesignStudioErrors ... How do we log errors ? It looks like we log it at the place where we catch the errors try { IdSwitchComponent.createSwitch( dsm.getSelectedLeafNodes() ); } catch (DesignStudioException e) { //? //logger.error(""MODEL_ERROR_LOOP_NOT_CREATED"", null, null, null); } This message is different from the actual error message in the exception.  We should log the original error message too. What if there is a call to logger.error() in the constructor of DesignStudioException in addition to the message where it is caught.  Ideally we want to use the same resourcekey for the logger also, today since the property files are different we have to duplicate the entries. Why can't we have one resource bundle for both log messages & errors ? Srik|||Ritesh: we use Logger to show messages to the user and it always uses message strings defined in StudioLogResource... So all messages shown to the user in message panel should come from StudioLogResource... For Exceptions also if we are defining certain error messages, should come from above resource bundle. We don't need two resource bundle.|||Srikanth: Ok. Unless I hear otherwise I'll consider Ritesh's suggestion as our approach. srik","Srikanth says there are currently two bundles of resources being used to log error messages, StudioLogResources for log messages and DesignStudioErrors for errors. He asks why they can't use a single resource bundle for both to avoid unnecessary duplication.

Can we make the shared files within the ECS ad EMAS be in a seperate package or directory? Just a thought. Rajeev|||Shashi: I believe this bug could have been caught even if minimum unit testing was performed. The code was checked in without running it through the automation tool or rendering an application on their machine. Irrespective of code review, unit testing should be performed to catch obvious issues. I agree that code needs to be reviewed by a person who knows the modules well. Perhaps, we can identify people who can code review what modules. If one person from the identified group is not available then a backup person can be contacted. As long as the code is reviewed by anyone from the established authorities. We used to have build file, but that is no longer available. We only have buildonce.

Thanks. -mamta|||Ravikumar: Rajeev, When we create a screen which has simple table alone is automatically adds ""next=continue"" in the aml generation. This ""next=continue"" should be generated only if the table is connected to a loopstep. Otherwise we should not generate next=continue. If we run this application ECS will hang. The application will not come up in Simulator Ravikumar.|||Rajeev: Ravi, Is this how ECS behaves? Are you aware of this? If so, please let me know ASAP so that we can make the changes in the ERT.

ERT needs to be fixed not to generate code this way. Ravi","Rajeev asks Mamta for more information about the bug. Mamta asks Ravikumar to answer Rajeev's bug questions. Ravikumar explains the bug to Rajeev, claiming ""next=continue"" adds when it shouldn't. Ravi says he is aware of this bug, and that is needs to be fixed so ""next=continue"" doesn't show up.","Mamta wants to know when is the bug 2538 issue to be included in the drop.  In order to assess the issue and why is it a bug, Rajeev needs to get more information from Mamta and talks to R clickmemo error about the behavior of the bug. The error is about creating a screen and then waiting to go to the next steps from there causes the computer to give run-time errors. Ravi says that when the client tries to run the RESUME state to continue to the next step, the previous step is in error therefore causing more run-time errors in the application and the whole application is hanging now.

I have never seen a requirement that we localize for Europe; only Japan. If this is just requiring that we do it at some point in the future, then fine -- we internationalized so we should be able to localize. But if we are saying that we are going to pay to localize now, I have a big problem with this. I have been told that English is okay for now until we have customers for deployment who demand localization.

Earlier understanding was: a) Rel 3.0 product will be tested with one European language ( for end device user messages). b) English version is ok for Release 3.0.

R&D is still figuring out the date by which time we can deliver Japanese on-line help and documentation [End of April is not commited]. From the market standpoint do we have any sense on the urgency of this requirement [no sale possible without this etc.] so that we can throw appropriate amount of money and people resources on it? Thanks Rajeev|||Glenn: Localization of online help is a new requirement from Europe. This is / was not scheduled for delivery in 3.0 and I am not suggesting we do so, but I think we'll be asked by at least one customer in Europe for this capability before the 3.5 release -- Peter in Germany expects to have a customer in Germany by the end of the quarter or early next quarter. I am more concerned about localization of error messages sent to the device. I was told that these error message strings were being externalized and that there were only five to ten of these messages. If this is true, I can have the folks in Europe translate the messages for us and have them sent back to us for incorporation into the product. Can we do this? Glenn.|||Steve: Okay, so as I understand it, we will not localize for Germany at this time. Om, please check per Rajeev's suggestion to understand the steps necessary to localize error messages to the device and to localize on-line help (two different efforts.

We need to have a list of those things requiring localization (e.g. not just the things above but EMAS messages, installation, docs, and so forth), an estimated time to complete, and a method to accomplish each. At that point, they may well request a localization of a subset of things and wait for 3.5 to localize completely. Thanks. \Steve|||Steve: Sounds good. Thanks Rajeev. \Steve|||Glenn: I have asked the folks in Europe if they can get the localized, tested resources bundles for the device error messages to us by the 19th. Will let you know what their response is once I receive it. To clarify, are you saying that if they do this we will include it in the 3.0 release and will not have to provide separate patches for the languages they localize for by the 19th? Glenn.","Steve is confused about why they are requiring different localization requirements for certain deadlines. Om explains to Steve the reasoning behind the European localization market. Rajeev jumps in to explain the Japanese localization market, but agrees with Steve about their approach. Glenn also further explains to Steve why it is important they work on European localization for their online help network. Steve replies that he understands the different localization requirements, and which countries they will and will not be working on.","The group chat is reading from a previous string, including all involved parties. Om offers up her expertise regarding message translation, asking if Ruth should be utilized. This drives a conversation about translation requirements, Steve notes that Tokyo documentation requires translation, Europe does not. Om agrees, noting that todays duties require different material. A conversation about what specific European documents require translation sparks. Steve produces a plan of action, Glenn concludes the string by distancing European projects from Tokyo-centric issues."

288,"Subject: opt-in feature|||Barbara: Tony, Realized that the opt-in feature isn't part of 6.0.  Will this be phased in before 6.1?  It's actually a very big feature because it allows clients to interact with their customers after they entered a sweepstakes or lead generation.  Since the majority of these customers don't automatically become paying customers an opt-in is their only chance to get permission to follow-up with them. Barbara|||Tony: Barbara, You're right, the bottom line is that it didn't get into 6.0.  There was quite a bit of groundwork done, but the feature wasn't exposed.  What happened was that it was implemented according to the original MRD, which called for the options to be mandatory & not editable, and then Sales & Client Services said it was essential to make them optional & editable.  That turned out not to be easy, and at the end of the day the feature was disabled. This feature can definitely be turned on for 6.1 -- the estimate is 1-2 days.  However, it's not on the plate now, and adding it will require either pushing something else off or slipping a bit.  I take it from your message that this is a priority.  Should we do this for 6.1, even if that means a slip? Tony|||Barbara: Tony, I know that we only had two weeks to complete the 6.1 items.  I never saw the final list for 6.1 that was agreed upon by engineering and Client Services.  I can't make the call to slip the date because it was based on client needs. The opt-in feature is definitely important, but if we haven't brought up this feature to our clients then they may not be aware this was an option.  Anytime we or our clients collect customer information we should always ask permission to communicate further. Barbara|||Marcia: This is my fault for specifying the feature one way and then, upon reflection and with additional feedback from clients, changing my input.

It turns out that we bit off more than we can chew with 6.0 and we need to focus our engineering resources on fixing what doesn't work within 6.0.|||Barbara: Okay sounds like this feature will be put on the backburner for now.

If I load a project then all data source are marked dirty if they have emds comments. so even though I did not make any changes when I try to open another project, I was asked to save my changes? I think we need to call different set of APIs when we load an object from file system and a different one when we need to modify something (for ex- emds_comments) in an object as a result of user action. Ritesh|||Tony: I don't think we can possibly implement a different set of APIs for loading Vs modifying properties - that can add too much to the size of the codebase. Instead, we should clear out all dirty flags at the end of a load, whether successful or not. That's easier to implement.

Then lastly, I added comments to Global. Still I didn't see the load problem. I haven't rebased today. So please show me this case on your m/c. May be this is as a result of lazy load code change and other changes that you have on your m/c. Thanks arun","Ritesh finds a problem with dirty flag. He suggests calling different sets of APIs when loading objects and when modifying objects. Tony says he thinks Ritesh's solution is bad because it would make the codebase too large.

Objects are shown as changed if file emds_comments had been changed. Tony thinks different APIs are overkill and that they could be erased on a file load.

325,"Subject: future of mobile imagining|||Ron: Attached is a brief report by Jupiter Comm on future of mobile imaging.  Jup is pretty bullish on sending images for entertainment purposes - not productivity. They look to Japan, where Bandai had 1.6MM subs by last summer (this is the second most popular individual app in Japan according to one source).  They believe this market will be like that for the Polaroid - quick and dirty is okay, I want it now. Jup does NOT believe video will be a big market anytime soon - too bandwidth intensive (think about it - you could put 4 calls on same bandwidth as one streamed video) One more data point for prioritizing the roadmap|||Toshiya: Bandai makes roughly $1 per subscriber per month off this application (Approximately $20 million per year!). Bandai is spinning this division off soon. Image handling is much more rich in Japan thanks to the handset capabilities. I agree that many of the applications for images will be entertainment driven. Many guys like Photonet are supplying services to consumers for uploading personal images (family photos etc.) to their handsets. I general, though, even in the business application area, imaging is more important than here in the US since cHTML can handle color images and many content providers take advantage of that to differenciate their services. The Java enabled handsets coming out in mid December will intially target the entertainment market and manipulating images is a large part of that. Would be happy to discuss this further if necessary. FYI, Prakash is visiting Tokyo next week to primarily to see Internet World Japan, so I think that he will have feedback regarding Japan market related issues soon.

There are several vendors that claim to be the preferred vendor for video delivery for NTT (such as Packet Video) and the truth seems to be that NTT is still trying to figure out how to proceed.

It will help me to resolve future conflicts without having to ask about them each time. Klee|||Nihar: Klee, Thanks for the reminder. From what I understand: operations use Production.ini for ECS and Std.ini for EPServlet. EPServlet CAN use Production.ini - you need to set CONFIG_PATH parameter in web server (ex. Netscape) configuration file. Ravi is the contact person to get exact information on this. If CONFIG_PATH is not specified, EPServlet defaults to d:PATH\std.ini. Q is: Do we document 'How to configure EPServlet?' in any of our manuals ?? If yes, we need to make sure that infomation about CONFIG_PATH setting is covered and we can remove reference to std.ini. Also we need to document that - if the web server you are using is 'ServletRunner' (this should happen only in development environment) - there is no way to set CONFIG_PATH i.e. std.ini will be used.

We need to document how to set the configuration file path in Netscape to use production.ini. Comments for bug 1708 describes exactly how to do this. If there are any further questions Yatin is the contact person. Then we can have references to a single file production.ini in all doc references.

Nihar believes this can be done, but wants to know if they should document their actions and suggests that Ravi confirms this can happen. Srik also chimes in to say that they should only use one file, but Ravi suggests that since the std.ini is only used for internal use that they only document how to use the production.ini in netscape.

I though Amitabh recommended an simple solution to this: ""Assume that the time is off by x hours [is that sufficient] and always download some more data."" Rajeev|||Keith: There was an email thread on this previously.  Rather than add complexity to our code Richard suggested its is the administrator's responsibility to sync the machine clocks. A comment to this effect used to be in the spec, but it got removed for some reason. Keith","Keith emails Dave to ask about syncing the clocks on the two servers so that data is not lost.  Prasad is under the impression it only has to do with the Siebels clock and not the OS clock.  Rajeev asks more questions and gives a suggestion that they write in code to make up for the lost data, but Keith reiterates that it is the administrators responsibility to sync the machine clocks.","Keith asks that a warning be added to an email regarding clocks on Siebel & OSA servers having to be in sync. Prasad mentions that the Siebel clock is the current solution, but seeks documentation. Rajeev asks if the machine clocks differ at a given time or over time.

Keith says Richard suggested that it's the admin's responsibility to add code complexity to sync clocks, and explains why it was removed from the spec."

We have checked the documentation but couldn't find appropriate answer for this Thanks Raam…|||Mahesh: Hi, There is no maximum limit for SERVLET_MIN_IDLE_PERIOD and MINIMUM_IDLE_PERIOD. When it is set higher, memory consumption would increase as more sessions will be in memory in  the webserver and EMAS respectively. Thanks, Mahesh|||Manabu: Mahesh, I would like to confirm one thing. Practically, your answer is correct. Theoritically, I think the maximum limit of SERVLET_MIN_IDLE_PERIOD and MIMIMUM_IDLE_PERIOD exsit. Because every development language(C, C+, Java and so on) have to follow the machine bit-size range (32, 64bits). I can tell the customer the two parameter doesn't have maximum number limit practical point of view but it will follow the range of type, such as integer and etcetera. Is it OK? Thanks, Manabu|||Mahesh: Manabu, yes, that is correct. To be exact, the max value for SERVLET_MIN_IDLE_PERIOD and MINIMUM_IDLE_PERIOD  is (Max value of integer)/1000 . The reason is we multiply the configured value  by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds . This multiplied value should fit in a integer. Thanks, Mahesh",Ramakrishna asks what the maximum limit is for SERVLET_MIN_IDLE_PERIOD and MINIMUM_IDLE_PERIOD. Mahesh says that there is no limit and when it is set higher the consumption would increase.

Mahesh confirms his response.,"Ramakrishna asks Mahesh for the maximum limits permitted for SERVLET_MIN_IDLE_PERIOD and MINIMUM_IDLE_PERIOD in epservlet.ini and server.ini.

For Palm VII and smartphone at the same time, login button works fine.   Following the debug process, I checked the Palm emulator also. It worked fine.  On 12:19, the login button on Omnisky is fine.So the conclusion we may draw is that it is probably the Omnisky gateway has short-term problem.

372,"Subject: parser version in the ert.|||Tony: The flows maintain the parser version that was last used with a particular page. Currently, the ERT picks up the latest parser version from the std.ini file to recreate the parser.

So, what parser version does the ECS use for the first page of the application? Thanks -Tony|||Rajeev: Good question. From the ERT perspective things should be okay since ERT will use the PATH/std.ini parser version to load the first page of the application.

The ert has been using parser version while the ECS was defaulting the settings but this wont work and they are asking both to upgrade to the necessary version to fix the ECS issue.

373,"Subject: supporting tomcat|||Ravi: We had a meeting (Srikanth, Myself and other EMAS/EMDS engineers) today to decide on the server's role in supporting preview functionality in EMDS. We all came to the conclusion that it is better to run the server locally to do preview. Following are the main reasons why a server needs to run locally - Few(No) changes in server code - Minimal changes in EMDS (i assume) - better response time as the request doesn't have to go over the network. The consequences of the above decision is that: - EMAS needs to be installed along with EMDS - A free JSP engine needs to be shipped along with each EMDS copy. - More testing effort that affects QA schedule because originally we decided to support only weblogic. Please let us know what you think. Ravi|||Prakash: Isn't our whole  development and license model change with this?Are we saying we bundle Tomcat? Prakash|||Ravi: Yes!

Thanks Srik","The decision is being made to run the server locally supporting preview functionality in EMDS.  The benefit of this approach include minimal changes to the server code, minimal changes in EMDS, and better response time.

This change may impact schedule and is something to address.","Ravi emails Prakask, Srikanth, and Amitabh about meeting they had regarding to the server's role in supporting the preview function in the October release of EMDS.

Was not certain what your plan was for this server so I did not go any further configuration-wise with him. Anyway you have full control over the box. Once you are done, we need to get the Outlook clients tested so that we can complete phase 1. Thanks, Steven|||Craig: what is the plan tho?  do they have their own domain or do they plan to be a slave to ours?  do they need their own internal machines setup on our dns with .avocadoit.com suffixes?  he won't be able to ping the internal dns since the return route isn't in the routing table on the internal dns server. I guess my question would be, what is the intent and purpose of their dns server.  they'll be using our wins server for NT name resolution.  the dns would only be for non-NT resolution. Craig|||Steve: Sorry, I thought that by asking Sitraka to set up a DNS server, there was some plan behind it...apparently not. From what I know, they do not have their own domain so it is EP's decision as to the necessity of a DNS server (faster for them? Whatever.). If they do not require an internal DNS server, they can already get to the WINS server. So, if that is all they need, then proceed with testing the Outlook client unless there is something else keeping us from doing that! Steve|||Craig: the only time dns came up is when I asked if they had one.  Then the conclusion was that they could point to their own isp's dns to get name resolution for the outside world (forwarders). As for internal dns, if they need one to authenticate or lookup internal dns names, that's fine.  I'll make it a slave of our internal dns server and do the needfull by updating our end and it'll propogate downstream any changes made....  Then I could add their machines that they want in the dns and be done with it. Craig|||Nadir: If we only need WINS then we need to exchange WINS server IP addresses to setup push/pull replication between the WINS servers.

Mitch wants to switch them to ChannelWave (CW), their new software, and the customers have requested that they are able to import their client contact record. For lead management software, I think this is important because this is where you track sales opportunities and what stage of the funnel they are in. The UK customers has 1400 contact records that they want to import, some in Germany presumably too. Mitch is asking David how difficult it will be for them to import these existing contact record and to get an estimate for the costs to do this. David has contacted these customers and said it will give them an estimate. Mitch is unclear if they will be providing the existing data that has been imported into ACT for David/CS to import into Channelwave, or if David or Customer Support will be doing the importing. Matt, CS, has asked for more on what ACT is. Matt is interested why they even switched to Channelwave if it's going to be a complicated and costly project to import a seemingly basic data record of the client contacts - Mitch confirmed that it is $100 per user and not very sophisticated.

For example, you have an invoice with Schumann Communication Srvs with a total balance of 270.68, accounting will only pay you 182.45 for current due.  So, instead of receiving 1207.68, your ER amount came up to 1119.45.  Also, you have a receipt hand written for 20.00 bucks, not sure if accounting will accept that.  For the hotel bill, please make sure that you divide everything by date.  Please separate lodging, phone calls and any room service if applicable. Other than that, slowly but surely, you're getting there!!!  I'll have to reward you once you have an ER with no errors!!!  =) Germana|||Germana: Hi Scott, Got your expense report and I must say, it was very challenging!!! It was not balancing for nothing!!!

Udo's agenda is to definitely push the overall program throughout the entire Delta network. His comments were that directly working with the Dallas team could possibly cause confusion to the overall program integration. Although he appreciates the proactivity and recognizes that Dallas would indeed be a good starting point for piloting, pursuing something right now with one specific group without the overall program getting full traction is not the best thing right now. Udo did recommend that I coordinate with Greg (Director working for Udo in charge of refining the overall program integration) in Atlanta on suggesting Dallas on as initial pilot location.

Thanks, Ricardo|||Ron: Ricardo and PM Team, A few thoughts: 1) We only show a connection to a web server (hosted) or intranet server (license) on the back end. I think this is NOT in our best interest; rather, let's show ability to connect to multitude of sources or simply label back-end source with a generic term (customer back-end systems) 2)Related to 1) above, we only show info coming in as HTML or XML. While I understand that the generic Java API will basically take data in as HTML, do we really want to raise this question from customers.  Similarly, with a JDBC call to a remote DB, while the request looks like an URL, is the output format HTML? 3) Any way to include voice?|||Ricardo: Ron, Regarding 1) I think that it would be a good idea to label the secure web server box to Customer Front-End or Back-End System. In the case of 2) I can add a table and an object icon to represent the interaction with databases and the interaction with remote objects that interact with other data sources. On the other hand, I wanted these diagrams to remain as simple as possible in order to convey a message focused on how we handle security. I think that it would be good idea to prepare another diagram to show the capabilities you have identified.

We have only received one file, are both diagrams in one document? Do either of them have any color? We need to have completed diagrams to place in the security release notes for distribution. Are they both simply black & white sketches? Can you enhance them with color? We were optimistic that we would be able to import as is.

Ricardo says he will rework the diagrams and resend later. Ricardo sends edited diagrams to Marilisa and tells her to add color if possible. Debbie tells Ricardo Marilisa can't open the file because Visio isn't on her computer and asks if he can add color prior to sending. Dan tells Debbie she can install Visio over the network.","Ricardo sends new security diagrams out for review, ideas for improvement are passed back. Ron suggests labels are put on the diagrams for better understanding, identity of the company.

If it is anythign to do with the move we can always go back to plan B and use the same Siebel serevr we have now. Prakash|||Steve: Prakash, Here is what we will be doing to accomodate this request. 1. There is ONE spare Dell 6350 server that Nadir will attempt to clone. If we cannot use this server for some reason, there are no other servers available until the ASP side is moved out of the corporate office. 2. Move the ASP services out (1.5 weeks). This will yield a few spares that can be used for cloning. 3. If the move time is insufficient, we can always load a new server with a clean operating system. However, I know that the reason for the cloning is due to the fact that it will take a good amount of Richard's time to configure it. We project cloning and setup to be 2 days minimum. Delivery of Option 1 is Monday. Delivery of Option 2 is two weeks. Delivery of Option 3 is 1 day. If you have any questions, please contact me.

I did run across one statement that said the MAX_OPEN_FILES should be equal to or less than ""cvpfreemax"".  This is currently set to 800. So the ""conservative"" approach would be to set to 800. I think in this case we should be conservative. Let's try 800. This value is recommended in more than one CCIUG e-mail. Bob|||Tony: Done.  Just set it to 800.

Or can you send me examples of what it looks like from the different devices or can you can give me any generalizations? Thank you, Doug|||Prasad: Doug, It is based on the HTTP request headers. --prasad|||Srikanth: Doug Did you get a response to this ? I think it comes from the HTTP request header.

Thanks for following up, Doug|||Jaigak: Doug, Although I'm not the best person to answer your question, I'd like to try as nobody answers yet. Yuyu, if I'm wrong, please correct me. The device type is identified by looking at HTTP header information when a HTTP request comes. One of useful headers is ""USER-AGENT"". USER-AGENT usually contains device model information and browser information. Sometimes gateway information, too. So if the device or the browser is known to us, we can decide the exact device type. For example, a USER-AGENT from a Siemens Phone looks like: User-Agent: SIE-C3I/1.0 UP/4.1.8c UP.Browser/4.1.8c-XXXX UP.Link/4.2. Here SIE-C3I is device model information and UP.Browser/4.1 is browser information. If device information is unknown, another HTTP header ""ACCEPT"" will be used. ""ACCEPT"" specifies acceptable markup languages (or appliations). For example, if ""ACCEPT"" has application/vnd.wap.wmlc, the device type can be WML device.

He is known for hiring excellent people and commanded the respect of his staff as well as the executive team within Oracle. I just found out that he is no longer with Corio and is looking for a VP of Marketing position in either B2B or wireless space.  Laurent should be a serious contender for this position at AvocadoIT.

476,"Subject: xsellsys: general question about search|||Darshan: I was just looking at the application for general use and wasn't able to look at detailed customer information for a particular account without clicking the arrow image on the view account screen (which can take a long time if there are lots of accounts in the system).  Did this issue come up before during development or design?  I tried the search function which displays the results, but does not let you click on the name to get the details. This might have been planned (customer request, technical limitations, etc.), but I was curious (maybe this was an item when Mehrak was handling the project).  If it is possible, I would think it would be useful to have the company names as hyperlinks on search results.  Any thoughts? Thanks. Darshan|||Narasing: Darsan, You are right, that would be useful if comany names have links in search results page. Since this search logic is very tedious and complex it would take very significant effort to add links in the serch page. Any how we are assessing the requird efforts and I will keep you update on this. Thanks Rao|||Narasing: Darsan, Tapaswi, the corresponding AE for this xSellsys project assessed the effort required to add hyper link to company name in search results page. This will require 5 working days including deveopment and testing of all three devices. This requires to change 4 pages per each device. Identify and render again for all devices for this feature to work. Please make note, this hyper link is not in the DDS.  We will wait for your decision on this. Thanks Rao|||Narasing: Darsan, Please ignore the previous e-mail saying, It requires 5 days to add links in search page. But we found out a short cut for solution. It may  need 1.5 days to fix this including testing. We will complete it by COB (Wednesday IDC). I will keep you update with the status. Thanks Rao|||Darshan: Please wait before deploying this feature into production as we should talk to the customer before making production updates.  Do you expect the implementation of this to cause any performance issues with the application (data transfer sizes or longer processing time on EMAS)? Maybe this can initially get deployed on the test server first to test with real devices.  I think this will be an important feature to make usage easier. Thanks. Darshan|||Tapaswi: Hi Darshan, I have modified the Search Results pages for both PDA and PocketPC.  And also, updated them in Testsrvr6 for testing. The url for testing PocketPC:		HTTP://LINK I am sending the PQA for testing the Palm app., as attachment. Please note that, we will deploy these files into production only after, you confirm it with the customer. Thanks, Tapaswi|||Darshan: That sounds great. We'll test them today. Thanks. Darshan|||Darshan: I tested it and I think it works great.  What do you think?  Should we go ahead and deploy this into production or ask/tell the customer? As I'm surprised that this has not already come up before (DDS or no DDS requirement), if we implement it without telling them it could avoid having to further customize the feature.  They may ask about making all search results hyperlinks which we certainly don't want to do for free.  It's also good to avoid any discussions about what was in or not in the original requirements. I'm interested to see what thoughts you have on the choice we have. Thanks. Darshan|||Narasing: Darsan, We put 30 man hours to add this feature, including the efforts development, testing and management. I go with you on this decision, that we deploy this feature first, then we can explain the customer to pay for the effort. Thanks Rao","The team has developed a palmtop app which shows search results as plain text. Darshan asks if the results should be hyperlinks instead. After some discussion, Rao determines the time required to implement this change. Since this time would be billable, Darsham wonders if this is something that the team should just implement as a best practice or whether they should propose it to the client as part of a more robust change management process.",Darshan notes that some customer search results require quite a few measures to be accessed. Narasing replies that he agrees that it would be useful to have links and outlines what would need to be done to implement this. He later writes to say that a shortcut has been found and that the feature will be implemented by the end of the next day. Darshan suggests running it by the customer before deployment in case performance is affected. Tapaswi details changes that they made to test versions. Darshan replies to say that the tests went well and asks about the choice to inform the customer.

Please ensure that the test machine (especially if it has server OS) is not already terminated into our local LAN to avoid any possible routing loops when performing this test. Failure to do so may produce faulty results (because you are routing to the Ethernet interface) or the Extranet switch may get confused having two routes to the same machine.

It was developed on 2.5 beta refresh 2 (NT). I'll clarify that with Steve in my next email but just wanted to get your thoughts. -Rishi|||Rishi: Steve, The USPS server would need to be setup with 2.5.054 NT since the USPS applications were completed, tested and accepted on that platform. Changing the build environment at this time would be difficult and time-consuming. -Rishi|||Steve: Rishi, I can appreciate the effort to keep the OS platform consistent. There are a limited number of NT servers available at QWEST and Exodus although I don't see a problem with hosting USPS. Migrating all servers to UUNET does mean that if we place USPS onto an NT platform, it will need to be migrated. This should be transparent to the customer as there are no changes to the URL.

But the thing is willhan need to write some script so that sampleapp will move to this structure with the InstallBuild. There was one bug opened today with PopulateDb HTTP://LINK i created  sampleapp using build 3.0 , and i found that in EMDS when u save the project it is not generating the AML page in the ImodeAml folder.

Thanks -Tony|||Wilhan: All, I am still not sure what is the finality is, so why dont we just wait for Tony and Nihar to finalize the structure tomorrow before I cut the CD. To summarize (so far) I think there are a couple of the issues: 1. examples directory (currently planned in the d:\installbuild\examples)  but where it should be put after the install ? 2. sampleApp directory (currently in the d:PATH\sampleApp) --  This one is the old one, shipped with previous 2.5, and installed into [Install_Location]:\sampleApp folder.
