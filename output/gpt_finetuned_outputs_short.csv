I will put together a set of scripts that operation intends to use in their monitoring enviorment to know the health of following.

25,"Subject: lilly demo: syncing with siebel|||Ray: Hey Andy, Just an FYI....and a small request. We will be onsite next wed at Eli Lilly and we want to show Live Siebel and our syncing solution demo.  I plan on showing the following: - Siebel Thin Client (HTTP://LINK SPORTER SPORTER.  Note EP1 no longer works. - Update an activity (bagel example).  Display device's screen on overhead. - Drop device in cradle for auto-sync. - Walk through messaging (3rd party data source, barcode scanning, sig capture, etc) Suggestion: - Rebrand demo with Lilly and EP Logo.  I can do this like I did for Aventis last week. - Support.  The meeting is at 10:00 am CST for 2 hours.  Can we get support from HQ in case the backend needs to be bounced? Clarification: - We are continuing to use 'old' code.  Reasons: 1) mPharma does not use 3rd party data source 2) mPharma does not auto-sync 3) mPharma does not provide Siebel thin client access to the real siebel data. Ray|||Andy: Hi Ray - Good luck at Lilly next week.  The rebranding sounds great.  Let me know if you need any help with graphics, but I think your pretty much good to go with that. As for the support, that would come from Richard's team and Michael. Richard - do you have someone available to monitor the servers for a live customer demo on Wed 8-10am PST?  Ray will be sync'ing to the EP Server and our Siebel server.  This does not require any development work, we just need someone to monitor the servers to make sure everything is running smoothly. Michael - would you please work with Richard's team to make sure that Siebel is running properly for the demo.  (Wed 8-10am PST) IMPORTANT - We are using the old demo app to sync.  We are not using the mPharma application. Please set up the servers accordingly. I would suggest coordinating a dry run of the sync on Tuesday since the meeting is on Wednesday. Thanks! Andy|||Stuart: Team, This is a very big meeting we should do everything possible to make this demo look great and powerful. Please let me know if you need anything from me... Thanks.

Please e-mail me back with suggestions on how to go about solving this. Thanks, Arun.|||Craig: Yup, I've totally slacked off.  I forgot about the etrade certificate.  I'll take care of that tommorrow. As for the error you are getting, unless etrade.avocadoit.com resolves to each and every box individually one at a time, your https will always throw up that error.  There is NO workaround for it.  Unless you go through the load balancer outside and it's real address. Craig|||John: Arun, Maybe in the short term, you can just test with http access. You may have to create a script that overwrites the /etc/hosts file with one that maps to a specific server box prior to running the automated test against a box.

I've got 2 questions regarding the designer: - how can I get the IP-address of the server, where an application is running, and assign it to a variable in the designer ? - switch-statement: in languages like 'C' or 'C++' a switch-statements contains of different 'cases' and a 'default'-case (that's what the program executes, if none of all other 'case'-values is true); how can I implement such a 'default'-case in the designer ? Pseudocode example: switch (devicetype): case POCKETPC: do some stuff default:            /* for all other devicetypes */ do some other stuff Thanks, I hope you are well after all these changes in the company ! Werner|||Diana: Hi Werner, Yes, I'm still with the company.  Our group is extremely small now.  It's really sad to see all this happening.  I heard that the Europe office is just you and Peter left.  Wow, this is really tough times.  Hopefully we can get through the bad times. To answer your questions: 1.  If you want to reference to the machine where the app is running, you should just use ""localhost"".  I think that would be the best way to go. 2.  For the switch statement, you can use value=""default"" in the tool.  Just use the word ""default"" as one of your values and assign it to any screen.  This should be your last value, very similar to that of c or c++.  It will server as a catch all. Hope this helps, and hope all is well.  Later.|||Werner: Hi Diana, I'm really glad to hear that you're still with the company ! Thanks for your reply, but I gave one more question regarding the IP address (I haven't described the problem clear enough in my previous mail): this is the scenario (we have to do 2 steps to get an image from the website to the device - this is due to the special design of this website): the application is started on a pocketpc; our application server (IPADDRESS) copies an image from the website to local disk space (this is done by an aml-script); then the pocketpc gets the image from here using e.g.: <img src=HTTP://LINK .... > so here I need the IP address of the application server, 'localhost' will not work here; is there a way to determine the IP-address of the application server ? Thanks again Werner|||Diana: Werner, I think you are talking about the KPMG project.  The aml script that you received saves the images to the local machine.  If the EMAS where the application is hosted and the webserver is on two different machine, the solution will not work.  You'll need to change the aml script such that it saves the image to the machine where the webserver is running.  In that case, you will know exactly what IP address to use in the application.  You can just hard code the IP address as the server address should not change often. I have attached the original java file for the aml script.  What you need to do is to make sure the path for the FileOutputStream is in the format ""HTTP://LINK  You would then reference the image using  ""HTTP://LINK This is the line you'll need to change: FileOutputStream outPut=new FileOutputStream(""/Netscape/Server4/docs/"" + s + "".gif""); Let me know if I have answered  your questions.|||Werner: Hi Diana, that answers my question, thanks a lot for your help !

That means that we need to port to HP UX before we can offer our licensed product with Sun.

If you have the same problem, even if you dont please do the following modification to circumvent the problem in log4j.ini (for EMAS) add the following log4j.category.avocadoit.online.parser=ERROR, A1 in designer.ini (for EMDS) add the following(in the log4j section) log4j.category.avocadoit.online.parser=ERROR, A1 This will override the default setting of DEBUG for the avocadoit root. Since the DEBUG is the highest level of debugging parser in particular for large data spends a lot of time in writing the log to the log file/debug file.

In a lot of cases when I did a quick search for  'Logger.debug' I found the following type of statements: logger.debug(""navigateButton_actionPerformed ""+ navigateButton.isSelected()); While this looks innocent, it is not encapsulated by an   'if(logger.isDebugEnabled()){   }' This means that there is still the String object creation overhead, in the above example 2 String instantiations happen at the minimum. Logger.java  does have a check to not log if debugging is off, however this only reduces the overhead of the call to log4j (next to nothing) and then the writing to disk.|||Arun: Adding the entry in ini really makes loading the page faster. It was a real pain to open any page before. Anyway, we really need to look at this whole logging mechanism and improve on it.

87,"Subject: simulation and ice browser|||Srikanth: Steve The integrated simulation and Java script project require's a decision to be made. There are no simulators available today with command line options.  As a result we will have to write our own html browser for the HTML based devices. - Do we use the ICEbrowser for this ? - java based. - easier to integrate - cost (unknown, heard some high estimates, need to confirm) - use ICE browser for simulation and then later replace our IE browser with this as well.  Using ICE browser will make the relative URL java script problem a non issue. - One can use IE for simulation ? - this will require activeX and we will be introducing more C++ dependency. - more work than ICEbrowser If a long term goal is going to be make the EMDS completely java based then we might want to start migrating to ICE browser. RItesh would require a decision from me.  I am leaning towards ICE browser, if the cost is not too prohibitive.

I went and spoke after this with Ritesh and Tony after this. Tony suggested another option for the next release perhaps we'll just use IE from the command line.   This will not be a ""tight integration"" but it will serve the prupose.  It does appear that the user will eventually still want to use the actual emulators shipped by the device manufacturer's. We'll design the framework such that the user's can plug in their choice of emulators and if they can't be started from the command line, we'll make it easy for them to get the start URL.  Hopefully in the future they can be started from the command line. Thanks Srik|||Steve: Srik, Before you shut out this alternative, please tell me the price you think would be acceptable.

The func spec is now improved to include ALL the relevant info about the install.  The messages and prompts have been cleaned up.  the screen shots updated. I request everyone (DOC and QA) to review this.  There was a recent bug fix to install pertaining to persistence, which adds a checkbox to the database panel. Thanks Srik|||Howard: Srik, While this is a big improvement, I'm pretty sure the file list is not accurate.  Here are some examples: *	Some listings still simply say ""all the files in this directory"" *	There are subdirectories, and it isn't clear if some files are in the directory specified, or in a sub-directory. *	In the Admin tool section, it says the epservlet.ini file is copied.  This seems like a mistake. -Howard|||Om: Praveen, Please two observations: 1. Change the title of the FS from ""AvocadoIT installation phase-II"" to ""Installation Release 3.0"" 2. Also please update History as and when you are changing the doc. Thanks Om|||Praveen: Srik, I updated the Func spec with the suggestions of Howard, and its very difficult for me to include all the file names in the sub sub folders of the build in the FS. I just specified what are the main files copied to the particular folders and the files generated by the Installer during installation.  I think this is fine.

100,"Subject: quicken usage reports|||Darshan: For Palm Usage:  When we initially deployed Quicken it did not send the deviceID value.  Now, users with an updated PQA do pass the Device ID value.  Since both PQAs are active, can you make sure that our usage reports still grab all the usage data regardless of deviceID value?  I don't see any deviceID with values of Null or Blank in the report (and I'm not sure what is displayed when a blank deviceID is passed), but wanted to make sure we aren't filtering out any actual usage because of the deviceID problem. Please let me know if this isn't clear (even sounds a little tricky to me). Thanks. Darshan|||Hung: Darshan, Is this gonna be the weekly report that we normally send to customers or this is for internal purpose.  Please confirm. Hung|||Darshan: Weekly report.  We want to make sure the weekly report is capturing all the appropriate usage regardless of deviceID.  Thanks.|||Hung: I am still not clear whether this set will be used and sent to customer regardless of the deviceid value.|||Darshan: Yes, it would be sent to the customer.  I don't feel confident that our filtering mechanism can tell the difference between garbage hits and real ones since deviceID being blank does not distinguish between the two.  Do you have knowledge on how any usage that does not show up in the reports is filtered out?  If we can't clearly tell, I much rather give the customer all the usage and they can then determine the test hits based on the information in the report. Thanks. Darshan",Darshan asks Hung/Steve about usage reports. Hung confirms a detail with Darshan. Hung is confused about another detail which Darshan confirms.,"Darshan requests that a weekly report be able to capture all usage in order to send to customers, regardless of deviceID."

105,"Subject: migrating to installanywhere - proposol to glen.|||Rajeev: Glen, Migration to InstallAnywhere buys us some key advantages i.e. not requiring JRE to be installed before running the install, HP support, NT service manager integeration. However, I am not clear on the cost front - (development, documentation, QA etc). Does the Cost that Praveen gave for development (25 days) cover the japanese install and the service pack install changes? Also, 4.0 release is quite different and may require significant changes in install - at which point we can plug in the the installer. Since the move to upgrade the installation is a ""Nice to have feature"" I like to punt on this and have people focus on 4.0 installation issues. In 4.0 we will use installAnywhere. What are your thoughts? Rajeev|||Glenn: I understand the JRE issue, but am not clear on what it buys us in terms of HP support and NT service manager integration. How do we install on HP today and what additional benefit will InstallAnywhere provide for the HP platform? What additional benefit does it provide for NT service manager integration? From the information provided below, I agree that there isn't enough incremental benefit to do this for 3.5, but I'd like to understand what the benefits / costs are to make a well informed decision.

First installing on any of the unix system and then make a tar file of the build 2.  unjar the tar file on HP system, and manually editing all the INI and BAT files. through InstallAnyWhere we can directly run the Launcher(executable) on the HP-UX system. and for NT Service Manager: Through InstallAnyWhere we can start, stop and pause any of the NT services and you can create the Services also.  with 3.5 release Admintool team is planning to install Admin as a service on NT.

Peter|||Dan: I'll call you tomorrow to chat further, but basically there used to be a group called Partner Solutions Group (PSG) that has been disbanded and is now part of Professional Services (PS). Also, Europe and Japan do not have a lot of PS support on site and are in very diff time zones so Sujan is asking about using SE's to do this (for now just in Europe). I've always felt that SE should do whatever it takes to win business. However, doing developer support is more of a post-sales activity. In the case of partners, SE has done some support (e.g. AC in VA). My main concern is the time-drain on SE and also the fact that an SE in general is not prepared to do full-blown developer support - that has typically been done by our in-house developers (AE).|||Peter: Dan, I misunderstood something. I thought you meant pre-sales developement work, i.e. building an ""off line"" prototype as part of a sales effort. I believe post sales should be handled almost exclusively by Sujan's group since the work should be paid for, or as a company we have decided to do some work for free for longer term gain - in which case Sujan should be give relief on his ""billability"" statistics.

Thanks, Ricardo|||Steve: Mike, Did we propose Premium service with dedicated servers to this customer? $4K sounds like Standard. Please confirm. Thanks, Steve|||Steve: Ricardo, Sorry for the delay. How do your hosting agreements specify things like time-out settings and other level of service terms? Settings that vary from application to application are not specified in the hosting agreement. This has more to do with functionality specific to the customer needs rather than a service level maintained for all applications. By default, if the timeout setting is different from any other application, it has to be placed on a standalone server. Five minutes is standard and should not be a problem on a shared server. If and when the customer wants to extend the timeout, the other applications will be considered and either inherit the setting or the app will be moved onto its own server. Because the customer has signed up for Standard service, eventhough the app may be hosted on its own server, the SLA is maintained at 95% for 12X5 coverage.|||Ricardo: Steve, No problem. Thank you for the response. Ricardo",Ricardo asks Steve some questions. Steve asks Mike for confirmation and then answers Ricardo's question.

Since USPS is a new project, let's set the proper procedures in place that we can apply to future projects. To solve this problem, I believe that we should perform the necessary switches on one or more of the global variables supported by the EMAS to distinguish the type of device that is requesting information from it. We can then create separate input steps, if needed be, for each device and do rendering accordingly. Here's some stuff I'm copying from our documentation:|||Rishi: Ruth, You wanted me to remind you to find out why the list of global variables do not exist in the new EMAS documentation. Rishi|||Dharma: Rishi, We have rendered usps application on smart phone. Now, we should work on RIM pager. We recevied your suggestion to create application for multiple devices in the same project. Could you please throw some light on implementation of it.   Also Baxish suggested that we can  pass one more parameter like device apart from the opt value. For ex: HTTP://LINK By using the device value in the first screen of the page, we can switch to either RIM step or smartphone step of the screen . We have implemented in one page and it is working fine. Please let us know whether we should  go ahead with this solution? Thanks, Sagar",Rishi is following up with Baxish about a technical issue and a potential fix and with Ruth about a reminder.

146,"Subject: regarding to login failure message bug ... 3863|||Kant: Regarding to bug HTTP://LINK it will works in JDB adapter but it may not work for ActiveX adapter. For ActiveX interface, Siebel will return 4096 for invalid logon and also for other errors that maybe or may not be logon related.  Thus in ActiveX version of the adapter, adapter can't tell from the return code what 4096 really means and thus won't re-map the return code to 407 (map to 500 for generic server error). So if OCA looking for return code 407 then do a special process (correct Siebel return message is in packet level error), it may have different behaviors between ActiveX and JDB ... According to below e-mail, README.TXT already stated that user may experience different behavior between ActiveX and JDB ... just want to we all agree on this. Please also see HTTP://LINK for additional information.|||Rajeev: OCA does special things for 407 [An error code that is defined by the Offline subsystem .. not individual adaptors]. For 407 error OCA is not only displaying the error message returned by OSA/Adaptor But more importantly it is also reseting the Record status from uploaded_modified/inserted to modified/inserted state etc. For other error types the records will be set to Error state....a very painfull thing fo the end device user. I would highly recommend that the ActiveX adaptor put the appropriate hack to return an 407 error in case of login failure. Rajeev|||Keith: We will make ActiveX return 407 based on any exception from the login call. We'll need another build/installer. We'll let you know when. Keith|||Geoff: This has been done. It is worth pointing out that the bug was filed for *all* error messages, not just the login message.  The login message is critical, and has been addressed.  All other messages remain unaccesible from applications. We should fix this after 2/28.|||Sanjay: I agree with Rajeev. You're better off mapping all login failure messages to 407.",There is a log in failure message bug due to the message code returned being unreadable by ActiveX. Rajeev suggests changing what the log in failure returns.,Kant emails the team about a login bug. Rajeev replies about the error. Keith and Geoff write back with an solution and Sanjay agrees with Rajeev.
147,"Subject: ""please wait"" for pda...|||Yuyu: We can implement ""please wait"" feature to those devices which support ""refresh"". ""refresh"" means, for example, if we send <meta http-equiv=""refresh"" cotent=""3;URL='HTTP://LINK ""> to IE browser, then IE will automatically load the URL every 3 seconds. Smart phones support ""refresh"", and we've provided ""please wait"" for them. As I remember, Palm HTML contains refresh, but I am not sure, you can look up the spec. For pocket PC, ""refresh"" must be there. Thanks! -yuyu|||Richard: Yuyu, Thanks for your help.  Yes, I also think Palm supports refresh.  I would like to plan on implementing this in the Aviva application because we know it's going to be very slow.  Prakash is trying to see what the issue is on their side.  Shailesh, please coordinate with John and Prakash for the priority of this project.  I believe Prakash is meeting with their CTO next week. Thanks, Richard|||Richard: thanks John.  we'll have to think about some other work around.  I just talked with Prakash, his meeting has been postponed so we can wait on a solution.|||Richard: I think one possible way is to implement ""please wait"" logic in a PRC then send a page which runs this app. (which would retry on a periodic basis).  This would probably be relatively simple for a Palm developer to add.  John, do you think we can get any takers (developers) to work on this on this IF you think it's a priority to provide this feature?|||John: Richard, Right now, AE in San Jose is booked at the present.  I can check with the Fleet Mortgage developers since they may be in a situation of waiting for customer signoff on a DDS for about 1 day so they may have some bandwidth if they haven't allocated this time for other Fleet activities such as documentation.  If they're busy, I'll ask IDC. I'm fairly sure it'll be the first PRC that AE has built so we might need some pointers from Sanjay. John|||John: Fleet Mortgage team, I heard from Rishi that he expects to get signoff from Fleet Mortgage on the RIM DDS by end of day Tues.  He said that the customer wants some revisions compared to the proposed DDS but Darshan has asked Rishi to try to push back with the customer since you two have completed development of the RIM app per the proposed DDS. Given that, I'm not too sure what other Fleet work you're involved with (possibly completing documentation for the PDA app). If you have some bandwidth on Tues, do either of you want to undertake writing a PRC file for a Palm application to effectively perform a ""please wait"" function so that the Palm gateway doesn't timeout the session if the customer's website is very slow.  Note, this is for a prospect demo for a company called Aviva that IDC has developed an application for. Would you please let me know if you have the bandwidth on Tues. & are interested in doing this.

So, in a matter of 2.5 hours, the server took three sessions (cumulative at 7:45 = 3015, at 11:10 = 3018) and memory increased by 557MB before rejecting sessions. Other servers took at least 300 sessions for that same timeframe. Also, this server had the least amount of total sessions for distribution. There are at least 4 other servers that took double the amount of total traffic up to tha point fo rejecting sessions. If you need additional information, let me know.

156,"Subject: as 400 support?|||Bradley: Team, I have a potential customer, The Venetian in Las Vegas, who is very serious about going wireless. A budget and timeframe already exists, however they do not want to do any integration work. All of their data and communication resides within their mainframe (IBM AS 400/3270 dumb terminals). This information includes player status, statistics, room status, typical hotel and casino data. They want to deploy a variety of devices within the casino to access the mainframe. Simply put by the customer, if we do not support the AS 400 without any significant integration work than we're out. Would it be possible to build an adaptor specific for this type of traffic? Most casinos and hotels in Las Vegas operate with this infrastructure. Your thoughts and comments would be appreciated. Bradley|||Ricardo: Is the functionality they are looking to mobilize transactional or view only?|||Bradley: Both.  They need to be able to view data on specific players and customers.  Details are limited at this point. I need to know what are limitations are to date.  Regardless of the DB, what would it take for EP to interoperate with an AS400?  Is it possible to build an adaptor specific to this type of architecture?  If not, I need to bring in an SI, or better understand our EAI story.  This deal won't fly with any integration work. Bradley|||Ricardo: Brad, It looks like they need to view information, but no updates to the data store are required. Where the data is stored is independent of the architecture. If the information is stored on a JDBC compliant database, then we should be able to mobilize it through the JDBC connector available in 3.0. If it's stored in a proprietary data store, and a Java interface already exist, then we could mobilize it through the Java API available in 3.0. Else a Java or web-interface  will have to be built in order for us to mobilize it. I hope this helps, Ricardo|||Bradley: That sounds good.

She thinks they are bringing dinner for about 20 people, not 40.  I think someone needs to assess the situation every night and every Friday for a little while, so we know what's going on.  What do you think? Susan|||David: I agree... In fact, that's what I was doing on Tuesday and Wednesday night. I was curious myself, so as soon as we started serving, I began counting people. On Tuesday night, dinner was supposed to be for 40, I counted 38 people eating, and there was just enough food left for a couple more. On Wednesday, we had sandwiches for 40, about twenty-five showed up, and there was about half left. Unfortunately, I had to leave before dinner last night, and I missed half of lunch today, but I will continue  to monitor this. Preliminary numbers suggest that Paul is doing ok, but we need more data. David|||Susan: Great!  Thanks for keeping on top of things. Susan|||Susan: I spoke with Doug today and told him that this would be the last week of dinners.  I already communicated this to the department heads last week, and they are supposed to talk to their groups and figure out a plan for their particular group.  I have asked them to not serve food up here, but to eat downstairs in the cafeteria.  I also told them that I would be sending out a general email to all of the employees today, which I will do this afternoon. Let me know if you have questions.

181,"Subject: bus dev|||George: david, just to be real clear. i know their is no disagreement the $12m bus dev commitment is for partner identified business. kraft is a partner deal. abn amro is not a partner deal|||David: George: I'd also like your agreement that where a partner adds significant value to EP closing a deal that we would not normally have gotten, then it should be considered a partner deal, as well.  Disney - identified by Grant, requires significant SI work, brought CGEY into picture because CGEY ""owns"" Disney - looks like a good combo.  In fact, there are going to be a lot of these type of cases.  In addition, I don't think an account is the way we want to count ""deals"", but really opportunities or specific projects within an account.  That's why we specifically put in the Prospect Registration Form.  Within any account, there could be many projects.  I wouldn't want to say categorically for example that ABM Amro is not a partner deal.  FedX is a very good example where Meltzer is working one opp and Accenture is bringing Meltzer into another. David|||George: we have had this conversation before and i still agree. i will pay on a per registered project and not a per client basis. with regard to bus dev helping on deals, that why you all have stock. in the case of close calls i hope you trust/respect me enough to know that i will do the right thing.  best regards  george|||Marie: George, Since Accenture and CGEY are expensive channels for us, I hope we are not involving them or relying on them unless they really are bringing value to opportunities that we can not close on ourselves. Marie|||David: I always trust you George. David|||David: Team: FYI ... I agree with George.  We need to make sure that the partners are bringing significant value to a deal, either by bringing us into the opportunity or, as in the case of USPS, really helping to close the deal.  As shareholders in the company, we certainly don't want to double pay for ""uncertain"" value. It also makes it imperative, that we understand, manage, and track partner opportunities appropriately.  I cannot emphasize this enough. Each of you should be responsible for really managing your partner opportunities.  There are too many instances where ""we"" brought them in, no ""we"" brought THEM in. Again, I'm asking for both Mitch's and Toni's great help in this area: to make sure that the info/projects are clear in Channelwave and the referring party is accurate. Thanks, everyone. David|||Mitch: Agreed,  I also think it is important to look at all opportunities we have and constantly evaluate where we need to engage a partner.  Not bringing them in just to bring them in, but to bring them in to win the business.  This week, we found out that there are projects going on in Sara, Bear Stearns and BofA that evolved independently of any partner introductions, even though partners had taken us in at other points in those companies.  At what point, if any, do we involve the partners in these opportunities?  In two instances (Sara, BofA), when I talked to the AM's they were not even aware we had partner connections in those accounts. I think ChannelWave will help all of you to see where we are engaged and to communicate with the AM to bring in the business. Mitch",David and George debate exactly which deals count as partner deals. Everyone agrees partners should only be brought in to gain projects that are unattainable otherwise.,George is confirming which deals are eligible dispersal of the bus development fund which is agreed upon.

186,"Subject: error messages + log messages|||Srikanth: All I want to clarify our logging + error handling framework. We have two resource bundles (properties) - Logging infrastructure uses StudioLogResource (this is for localizing the log messages) Errors uses DesignStudioErrors ... How do we log errors ? It looks like we log it at the place where we catch the errors try { IdSwitchComponent.createSwitch( dsm.getSelectedLeafNodes() ); } catch (DesignStudioException e) { //? //logger.error(""MODEL_ERROR_LOOP_NOT_CREATED"", null, null, null); } This message is different from the actual error message in the exception.  We should log the original error message too. What if there is a call to logger.error() in the constructor of DesignStudioException in addition to the message where it is caught.  Ideally we want to use the same resourcekey for the logger also, today since the property files are different we have to duplicate the entries. Why can't we have one resource bundle for both log messages & errors ? Srik|||Ritesh: we use Logger to show messages to the user and it always uses message strings defined in StudioLogResource... So all messages shown to the user in message panel should come from StudioLogResource... For Exceptions also if we are defining certain error messages, should come from above resource bundle. We don't need two resource bundle.|||Srikanth: Ok. Unless I hear otherwise I'll consider Ritesh's suggestion as our approach. srik","Srikanth asks why there are two bundles of resources for logging/handling errors, and Ritesh says that there should only be one, StudioLogResource.

We can restrict this by saying ""buildonce"" should be done whenever developer adds new files. Is this a reasonable assumption? Ravi|||Rajeev: Om, Please remain on top of this. Can we make the shared files within the ECS ad EMAS be in a seperate package or directory? Just a thought. Rajeev|||Shashi: I believe this bug could have been caught even if minimum unit testing was performed. The code was checked in without running it through the automation tool or rendering an application on their machine. Irrespective of code review, unit testing should be performed to catch obvious issues. I agree that code needs to be reviewed by a person who knows the modules well. Perhaps, we can identify people who can code review what modules. If one person from the identified group is not available then a backup person can be contacted. As long as the code is reviewed by anyone from the established authorities. We used to have build file, but that is no longer available. We only have buildonce. We need a real make file that handles dependency issues so the developer does not need to be concerned about such things.

I imagine that even when the app stuff is completely separated from the platform, it would make sense to have a single ssc system. - Dave.|||Richard: Dave, I agree, it makes sense for us to be on one system. Assuming there aren't licensing or other issues, we'll schedule the migration over the next month or so. Thanks, Richard|||Dave: I was thinking that even if the full migration out of sourcesafe takes place over the next month or so, there could be at least one person in your group who simply has clearcase installed immediately.  This would enable an AE to perform the clearcase checkin process we have now, without waiting for a migration to occur. This will ease the situation immediately, and begin putting some knowledge about how to use clearcase into the hands of AEs, which will be needed for the eventual transition anyway. - Dave.|||Richard: o.k. let me see what I can workout with Prakash and the team.|||Prakash: I agree with Dave, this is somethign we should do it sooner than later.Richard, let us talk when you have time.

But if we are saying that we are going to pay to localize now, I have a big problem with this. I have been told that English is okay for now until we have customers for deployment who demand localization. Please don't start localizing for Europe until I understand that there is a change in requirements that is required for Q1 revenue. Maybe there is a change and I just don't know it. Please let me know. Thanks. \Steve|||Om: Steve, 1. Earlier understanding was: a) Rel 3.0 product will be tested with one European language ( for end device user messages). b) English version is ok for Release 3.0. PM had to still confirm, I was following it up. 2. Lacalizing Online help for Europe is a new requirement. Om|||Rajeev: See embeded comments. Steve, Thanks for jumping in. I agree with you 100%. R&D is still figuring out the date by which time we can deliver Japanese on-line help and documentation [End of April is not commited]. From the market standpoint do we have any sense on the urgency of this requirement [no sale possible without this etc.] so that we can throw appropriate amount of money and people resources on it? Thanks Rajeev|||Glenn: Localization of online help is a new requirement from Europe. This is / was not scheduled for delivery in 3.0 and I am not suggesting we do so, but I think we'll be asked by at least one customer in Europe for this capability before the 3.5 release -- Peter in Germany expects to have a customer in Germany by the end of the quarter or early next quarter. I am more concerned about localization of error messages sent to the device. I was told that these error message strings were being externalized and that there were only five to ten of these messages. If this is true, I can have the folks in Europe translate the messages for us and have them sent back to us for incorporation into the product. Can we do this? Glenn.|||Steve: Okay, so as I understand it, we will not localize for Germany at this time. Om, please check per Rajeev's suggestion to understand the steps necessary to localize error messages to the device and to localize on-line help (two different efforts. If it helps, picture this scenario: we deliver English 3.0 to Europe, and in May or June, they say they want the product localized to German. We need to have a list of those things requiring localization (e.g. not just the things above but EMAS messages, installation, docs, and so forth), an estimated time to complete, and a method to accomplish each. At that point, they may well request a localization of a subset of things and wait for 3.5 to localize completely. Thanks. \Steve|||Steve: Sounds good. Thanks Rajeev. \Steve|||Glenn: I have asked the folks in Europe if they can get the localized, tested resources bundles for the device error messages to us by the 19th. Will let you know what their response is once I receive it. To clarify, are you saying that if they do this we will include it in the 3.0 release and will not have to provide separate patches for the languages they localize for by the 19th? Glenn.","Steve is confused about the different localization requirements going on, and what their points are. Om, Rajeev, and Glenn explain the different localization requirements to Steve.",A change in requirements is suggested due to a potential customer in Europe who may need online documentation and error messages localized by the end of the quarter.

288,"Subject: opt-in feature|||Barbara: Tony, Realized that the opt-in feature isn't part of 6.0.  Will this be phased in before 6.1?  It's actually a very big feature because it allows clients to interact with their customers after they entered a sweepstakes or lead generation.  Since the majority of these customers don't automatically become paying customers an opt-in is their only chance to get permission to follow-up with them. Barbara|||Tony: Barbara, You're right, the bottom line is that it didn't get into 6.0.  There was quite a bit of groundwork done, but the feature wasn't exposed.  What happened was that it was implemented according to the original MRD, which called for the options to be mandatory & not editable, and then Sales & Client Services said it was essential to make them optional & editable.  That turned out not to be easy, and at the end of the day the feature was disabled. This feature can definitely be turned on for 6.1 -- the estimate is 1-2 days.  However, it's not on the plate now, and adding it will require either pushing something else off or slipping a bit.  I take it from your message that this is a priority.  Should we do this for 6.1, even if that means a slip? Tony|||Barbara: Tony, I know that we only had two weeks to complete the 6.1 items.  I never saw the final list for 6.1 that was agreed upon by engineering and Client Services.  I can't make the call to slip the date because it was based on client needs. The opt-in feature is definitely important, but if we haven't brought up this feature to our clients then they may not be aware this was an option.  Anytime we or our clients collect customer information we should always ask permission to communicate further. Barbara|||Marcia: This is my fault for specifying the feature one way and then, upon reflection and with additional feedback from clients, changing my input. Barbara you are doing a fabulous job of evangalizing best practices.  Even so, we need to get 6.0 fixed before we can have the engineering team move on to new features in 6.0.  It turns out that we bit off more than we can chew with 6.0 and we need to focus our engineering resources on fixing what doesn't work within 6.0.|||Barbara: Okay sounds like this feature will be put on the backburner for now.  But, I would love this in 7.0!",Barbara asks colleagues if opt-in feature will be in before version 6.1.

We could probably swap things around if necessary and hold the training next week but my understanding was that the contract may not have been signed in time to do this. If we could do the training next week it would probably be better because Toshi wanted us to do a Sys Admin training the following week and we could get the Stellcom guys to attend both courses. If they've signed an LOI and and NDA is there any reason why they couldn't come for training next week?

306,"Subject: dirty flag problem|||Ritesh: I see some problem in the way dirty flag is used. If I load a project then all data source are marked dirty if they have emds comments. so even though I did not make any changes when I try to open another project, I was asked to save my changes? I think we need to call different set of APIs when we load an object from file system and a different one when we need to modify something (for ex- emds_comments) in an object as a result of user action. Ritesh|||Tony: I don't think we can possibly implement a different set of APIs for loading Vs modifying properties - that can add too much to the size of the codebase. Instead, we should clear out all dirty flags at the end of a load, whether successful or not. That's easier to implement. Arun has already taken care of clearing the dirty flag at the end of a load, though she said this area needs more testing. please show her this one too so she can take care of it. Thanks -Tony|||Arun: Ritesh I just loaded a project which has 5 pages. First I tested the case where only page1 had comments. Then I tested the case where all 5 pages had comments. Then lastly, I added comments to Global. Still I didn't see the load problem. I haven't rebased today. So please show me this case on your m/c. May be this is as a result of lazy load code change and other changes that you have on your m/c. Thanks arun",Ritesh discovers a problem with dirty flag. He suggests a solution.

Jup is pretty bullish on sending images for entertainment purposes - not productivity. They look to Japan, where Bandai had 1.6MM subs by last summer (this is the second most popular individual app in Japan according to one source).  They believe this market will be like that for the Polaroid - quick and dirty is okay, I want it now. Jup does NOT believe video will be a big market anytime soon - too bandwidth intensive (think about it - you could put 4 calls on same bandwidth as one streamed video) One more data point for prioritizing the roadmap|||Toshiya: Bandai makes roughly $1 per subscriber per month off this application (Approximately $20 million per year!). Bandai is spinning this division off soon. Image handling is much more rich in Japan thanks to the handset capabilities. I agree that many of the applications for images will be entertainment driven. Many guys like Photonet are supplying services to consumers for uploading personal images (family photos etc.) to their handsets. I general, though, even in the business application area, imaging is more important than here in the US since cHTML can handle color images and many content providers take advantage of that to differenciate their services. The Java enabled handsets coming out in mid December will intially target the entertainment market and manipulating images is a large part of that.

329,"Subject: any database testing|||Rajeev: Divakar, One does not have to run EMDS through the Rational Tool to certify a database. Howard just certified Oracle 8.1. He can best tell you what set of tests were run for certification. I am under the impression that the cost was areound 2-3 person days for this certification and it were manual tests. Please work with Howard on this. Rajeev|||Divakar: Rajeev, I will not put it in the same league as 8.1 certification, which was an upgrade of a version with the same vendor. For anydb we modified the SQL statements and the scripts, for each vendor they will be different. Apart from developing an App with designer, I will be more comfortable doing the automated certification suite for the designer for each vendor. Howard, We will be sending the design notes of the code changes today, please review and advise on the testing strategy. Thanks, diva.|||Howard: Divakar, You are correct in that moving the product from 8.0.5 to 8.1 is on a different scale than supporting different vendor's databases (and generalizing the database support).  However, the test scenarios don't change - you need to test every point of interaction between the product and the database.  The main difference, from a testing standpoint, is that the test cases are more likely to identify problems due to the depth of the code changes. The automated test suite is valuable.  The database tests that we can share with you that we used in the 8.0.5 to 8.1 upgrade should be complete as well. -Howard|||Howard: Here is the list of test cases we used for Oracle 8i.",Rajeev and Divakar discuss database testing and certification.

If we were to do one, we'd need to be careful that internal IT doesn't start competing with the demo's functionality to prove that they can do a better job with tools from Edify or WebLogic.

It will help me to resolve future conflicts without having to ask about them each time. Klee|||Nihar: Klee, Thanks for the reminder. From what I understand: operations use Production.ini for ECS and Std.ini for EPServlet. EPServlet CAN use Production.ini - you need to set CONFIG_PATH parameter in web server (ex. Netscape) configuration file. Ravi is the contact person to get exact information on this. If CONFIG_PATH is not specified, EPServlet defaults to d:PATH\std.ini. Q is: Do we document 'How to configure EPServlet?' in any of our manuals ?? If yes, we need to make sure that infomation about CONFIG_PATH setting is covered and we can remove reference to std.ini. Also we need to document that - if the web server you are using is 'ServletRunner' (this should happen only in development environment) - there is no way to set CONFIG_PATH i.e. std.ini will be used. Confirm this wil Ravi. - Nihar|||Srikanth: Nihar, Ravi We should try and fix this and ensure that only one ini file is used.  Two ini files are confusing. I suggest that we get an answer to DOC by today as to whether this can be fixed or not. Thanks Srik|||Ravi: Whatever Nihar has mentioned is accurate. Yes! We need to document how to set the configuration file path in Netscape to use production.ini. Comments for bug 1708 describes exactly how to do this. If there are any further questions Yatin is the contact person. Then we can have references to a single file production.ini in all doc references.

Thanks, Manabu|||Mahesh: Manabu, yes, that is correct. To be exact, the max value for SERVLET_MIN_IDLE_PERIOD and MINIMUM_IDLE_PERIOD  is (Max value of integer)/1000 . The reason is we multiply the configured value  by 1000 to convert it to milliseconds . This multiplied value should fit in a integer.

We all came to the conclusion that it is better to run the server locally to do preview. Following are the main reasons why a server needs to run locally - Few(No) changes in server code - Minimal changes in EMDS (i assume) - better response time as the request doesn't have to go over the network. The consequences of the above decision is that: - EMAS needs to be installed along with EMDS - A free JSP engine needs to be shipped along with each EMDS copy. - More testing effort that affects QA schedule because originally we decided to support only weblogic.

This means we need to bundle Tomcat. The question is, is this acceptable? If not, we need to find alternative solutions to preview functionality. Ravi|||Prakash: Amitabh, Please take it all the way through. I would have prefred a different way with only the designer in the act. If it is not doable within the timeframe minimize the schedule impact. Toronto folks have done Tomcat bundling as part of RC. We may be able to leverage that. Prakash|||Srikanth: Amitabh We need to resolve this issue for ""simulation"" in general, unless we mandate that simulation will require a ""save + deploy"" before being able to simulate. Thanks Srik",The decision is being made to run the server locally for efficiency to effectiveness.  This decision requires a change in the plan and bundling of Tomcat.,The team decides to run the server locally for preview functionality of EMDS. This means TOMCAT has to be bundled. Prakash prefers that TORONTO handle it due to the timeframe.

Currently, Civista is in the UK, Spain and Italy. Based on what I have read so far - they are definitely competitive. My initial impression is that they offer an ASP (hosted) model and are working on the licensed model - It seems that because they are based in Europe, they interact with the GSM systems in a more robust manner - i.e. - they support SMS only enabled phones - being a lower common denominator than WAP enabled phones, plus they can take advantage of SIM toolkit (added security and paplicaitons) functionality.

He has configured a LINUX server (IPADDRESS) for us with login:avocadoit, pass:avocadoit (root access). He can ping our primary WINS server from this machine but not our internal DNS. Was not certain what your plan was for this server so I did not go any further configuration-wise with him. Anyway you have full control over the box. Once you are done, we need to get the Outlook clients tested so that we can complete phase 1. Thanks, Steven|||Craig: what is the plan tho?  do they have their own domain or do they plan to be a slave to ours?  do they need their own internal machines setup on our dns with .avocadoit.com suffixes?  he won't be able to ping the internal dns since the return route isn't in the routing table on the internal dns server. I guess my question would be, what is the intent and purpose of their dns server.  they'll be using our wins server for NT name resolution.  the dns would only be for non-NT resolution. Craig|||Steve: Sorry, I thought that by asking Sitraka to set up a DNS server, there was some plan behind it...apparently not. From what I know, they do not have their own domain so it is EP's decision as to the necessity of a DNS server (faster for them? Whatever.). If they do not require an internal DNS server, they can already get to the WINS server. So, if that is all they need, then proceed with testing the Outlook client unless there is something else keeping us from doing that! Steve|||Craig: the only time dns came up is when I asked if they had one.  Then the conclusion was that they could point to their own isp's dns to get name resolution for the outside world (forwarders). As for internal dns, if they need one to authenticate or lookup internal dns names, that's fine.  I'll make it a slave of our internal dns server and do the needfull by updating our end and it'll propogate downstream any changes made....  Then I could add their machines that they want in the dns and be done with it. Craig|||Nadir: If we only need WINS then we need to exchange WINS server IP addresses to setup push/pull replication between the WINS servers. They will setup our WINS a partner to replicate to and so will we. Once replicated name resolution for all Windows based systems should work and then we can test the mail client. Nadir",A group of IT professions discuss the establishment of an internal DNS server.  They also discuss the testing of a mail client.,Steve is asking Craig and Keith about the clients use of AvocadoIT as a DNS server. There seems to be confusion as to what exactly the client needs.

Udo's agenda is to definitely push the overall program throughout the entire Delta network. His comments were that directly working with the Dallas team could possibly cause confusion to the overall program integration. Although he appreciates the proactivity and recognizes that Dallas would indeed be a good starting point for piloting, pursuing something right now with one specific group without the overall program getting full traction is not the best thing right now.

428,"Subject: updated security diagrams|||Ricardo: Team, Attached are the new security diagrams for the licensed and ASP offerings. Please provide your feedback. Thanks, Ricardo|||Ron: Ricardo and PM Team, A few thoughts: 1) We only show a connection to a web server (hosted) or intranet server (license) on the back end. I think this is NOT in our best interest; rather, let's show ability to connect to multitude of sources or simply label back-end source with a generic term (customer back-end systems) 2)Related to 1) above, we only show info coming in as HTML or XML. While I understand that the generic Java API will basically take data in as HTML, do we really want to raise this question from customers.  Similarly, with a JDBC call to a remote DB, while the request looks like an URL, is the output format HTML? 3) Any way to include voice?|||Ricardo: Ron, Regarding 1) I think that it would be a good idea to label the secure web server box to Customer Front-End or Back-End System. In the case of 2) I can add a table and an object icon to represent the interaction with databases and the interaction with remote objects that interact with other data sources. On the other hand, I wanted these diagrams to remain as simple as possible in order to convey a message focused on how we handle security. I think that it would be good idea to prepare another diagram to show the capabilities you have identified.

Carlos|||Prakash: Nadir/Steve, What we need here  is to mirror the 3G drives on the Siebel system. If  there are other issues that are preventing this pls let me know. If it is anythign to do with the move we can always go back to plan B and use the same Siebel serevr we have now. Prakash|||Steve: Prakash, Here is what we will be doing to accomodate this request. 1. There is ONE spare Dell 6350 server that Nadir will attempt to clone. If we cannot use this server for some reason, there are no other servers available until the ASP side is moved out of the corporate office. 2. Move the ASP services out (1.5 weeks).

474,"Subject: epdevice: a symbol populated by the first the first request by a handheld device.|||Doug: Greetings, I am conducting a Developing Mobile Applications course for 4 consultants (3 from ADDRESS Consulting and one from Stellcom) this week. The question came up about the value in epdevice:  Is the device type identifier (PDA, WML, HDML, CHTML) derived from an HTTP request?  Or an IP layer 2 (for example, get) statement?  Or can you send me examples of what it looks like from the different devices or can you can give me any generalizations? Thank you, Doug|||Prasad: Doug, It is based on the HTTP request headers. --prasad|||Srikanth: Doug Did you get a response to this ? I think it comes from the HTTP request header. Yuyu and or Krishna  Ganti in R&D can provide a more detailed answer. Srik|||Doug: Srik, The reply that I got from Prasad is below. Thanks for following up, Doug|||Jaigak: Doug, Although I'm not the best person to answer your question, I'd like to try as nobody answers yet. Yuyu, if I'm wrong, please correct me. The device type is identified by looking at HTTP header information when a HTTP request comes. One of useful headers is ""USER-AGENT"". USER-AGENT usually contains device model information and browser information. Sometimes gateway information, too. So if the device or the browser is known to us, we can decide the exact device type. For example, a USER-AGENT from a Siemens Phone looks like: User-Agent: SIE-C3I/1.0 UP/4.1.8c UP.Browser/4.1.8c-XXXX UP.Link/4.2. Here SIE-C3I is device model information and UP.Browser/4.1 is browser information. If device information is unknown, another HTTP header ""ACCEPT"" will be used. ""ACCEPT"" specifies acceptable markup languages (or appliations). For example, if ""ACCEPT"" has application/vnd.wap.wmlc, the device type can be WML device. For further device header information, please take a look at HTTP://LINK Thanks, Jaigak|||Doug: Jaigak, Thank you for a very thorough explanation. Regards, Doug|||Doug: You may be interested in the information below ...",Doug is developing a Mobile Applications course for four consultants.

Did this issue come up before during development or design?  I tried the search function which displays the results, but does not let you click on the name to get the details. This might have been planned (customer request, technical limitations, etc.), but I was curious (maybe this was an item when Mehrak was handling the project).  If it is possible, I would think it would be useful to have the company names as hyperlinks on search results.  Any thoughts? Thanks. Darshan|||Narasing: Darsan, You are right, that would be useful if comany names have links in search results page. Since this search logic is very tedious and complex it would take very significant effort to add links in the serch page. Any how we are assessing the requird efforts and I will keep you update on this. Thanks Rao|||Narasing: Darsan, Tapaswi, the corresponding AE for this xSellsys project assessed the effort required to add hyper link to company name in search results page. This will require 5 working days including deveopment and testing of all three devices. This requires to change 4 pages per each device.

Do you expect the implementation of this to cause any performance issues with the application (data transfer sizes or longer processing time on EMAS)? Maybe this can initially get deployed on the test server first to test with real devices.  I think this will be an important feature to make usage easier. Thanks.

Darshan|||Darshan: I tested it and I think it works great.  What do you think?  Should we go ahead and deploy this into production or ask/tell the customer? As I'm surprised that this has not already come up before (DDS or no DDS requirement), if we implement it without telling them it could avoid having to further customize the feature.  They may ask about making all search results hyperlinks which we certainly don't want to do for free.  It's also good to avoid any discussions about what was in or not in the original requirements. I'm interested to see what thoughts you have on the choice we have. Thanks.

Please let me know when can we do this. vinayak|||Steve: Word of caution. From your comments below, you will be dialing out of this connection and establishing a ""trusted"" tunnel to our network. Please ensure that the test machine (especially if it has server OS) is not already terminated into our local LAN to avoid any possible routing loops when performing this test. Failure to do so may produce faulty results (because you are routing to the Ethernet interface) or the Extranet switch may get confused having two routes to the same machine. The latter should not occur if you are obtaining the addresses from the Extranet switch however, the workstation should be removed from the LAN to be certain.|||Vinayak: I will remove my LAN connection while testing. regards, vinayak|||Vinayak: Nadir, OS on My desktop is Windows NT 4.0.

I wanted to find out from you about the status of a production server for the USPS application. Can you please update me with the status so that I can plan accordingly. Thanks, Rishi|||Steve: Rishi, Thanks. We have sufficient servers for USPS. Preferred platform is Solaris. Steve|||Rishi: Should we plan on migrating USPS to 3.0 GA Solaris ? It was developed on 2.5 beta refresh 2 (NT). I'll clarify that with Steve in my next email but just wanted to get your thoughts. -Rishi|||Rishi: Steve, The USPS server would need to be setup with 2.5.054 NT since the USPS applications were completed, tested and accepted on that platform. Changing the build environment at this time would be difficult and time-consuming. -Rishi|||Steve: Rishi, I can appreciate the effort to keep the OS platform consistent. There are a limited number of NT servers available at QWEST and Exodus although I don't see a problem with hosting USPS. Migrating all servers to UUNET does mean that if we place USPS onto an NT platform, it will need to be migrated. This should be transparent to the customer as there are no changes to the URL.

Thanks Praveen|||Wilhan: Hi Praveen, The examples folder is under installbuild (d:PATH\examples), and you should get it recursively.  About where it is suppose to be installed, I myself not too sure, since it was not mentioned.  Nihar will probably has better idea. Thanks, Wilhan|||Rajeev: Nihar, Tony, Nihiar can you resolve this along with Tony. There are now a few examples that we will ship with. {AvocadoIT  Install Dir}/Samples/<Sample name>/files would be ideal. However I do not know whether the sample apps will work if they are installed in such a directory structure. Rajeev|||Praveen: Rajeev, I think sampleapp will work in this structure also , because the end user manuall run the PopulateDB.bat file to upload this application to the Database and at that time running this PopulateDB he will give this directory structure. But the thing is willhan need to write some script so that sampleapp will move to this structure with the InstallBuild. There was one bug opened today with PopulateDb HTTP://LINK i created  sampleapp using build 3.0 , and i found that in EMDS when u save the project it is not generating the AML page in the ImodeAml folder. Is this a bug? or expected behaviour.  Note that DesignerNT.bat is pointing to JRE1.2 Thanks Praveen|||Tony: Please see my comments below. Thanks -Tony|||Wilhan: All, I am still not sure what is the finality is, so why dont we just wait for Tony and Nihar to finalize the structure tomorrow before I cut the CD. To summarize (so far) I think there are a couple of the issues: 1. examples directory (currently planned in the d:\installbuild\examples)  but where it should be put after the install ? 2. sampleApp directory (currently in the d:PATH\sampleApp) --  This one is the old one, shipped with previous 2.5, and installed into [Install_Location]:\sampleApp folder.
