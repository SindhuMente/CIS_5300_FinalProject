Pseudocode example: switch (devicetype): case POCKETPC: do some stuff default:            /* for all other devicetypes */ do some other stuff Thanks, I hope you are well after all these changes in the company ! Werner|||Diana: Hi Werner, Yes, I'm still with the company.  Our group is extremely small now.  It's really sad to see all this happening.  I heard that the Europe office is just you and Peter left.  Wow, this is really tough times.  Hopefully we can get through the bad times. To answer your questions: 1.  If you want to reference to the machine where the app is running, you should just use ""localhost"".  I think that would be the best way to go. 2.  For the switch statement, you can use value=""default"" in the tool.  Just use the word ""default"" as one of your values and assign it to any screen.  This should be your last value, very similar to that of c or c++.  It will server as a catch all. Hope this helps, and hope all is well.  Later.|||Werner: Hi Diana, I'm really glad to hear that you're still with the company ! Thanks for your reply, but I gave one more question regarding the IP address (I haven't described the problem clear enough in my previous mail): this is the scenario (we have to do 2 steps to get an image from the website to the device - this is due to the special design of this website): the application is started on a pocketpc; our application server (IPADDRESS) copies an image from the website to local disk space (this is done by an aml-script); then the pocketpc gets the image from here using e.g.: <img src=HTTP://LINK .... > so here I need the IP address of the application server, 'localhost' will not work here; is there a way to determine the IP-address of the application server ? Thanks again Werner|||Diana: Werner, I think you are talking about the KPMG project.  The aml script that you received saves the images to the local machine.  If the EMAS where the application is hosted and the webserver is on two different machine, the solution will not work.  You'll need to change the aml script such that it saves the image to the machine where the webserver is running.  In that case, you will know exactly what IP address to use in the application.  You can just hard code the IP address as the server address should not change often. I have attached the original java file for the aml script.  What you need to do is to make sure the path for the FileOutputStream is in the format ""HTTP://LINK  You would then reference the image using  ""HTTP://LINK This is the line you'll need to change: FileOutputStream outPut=new FileOutputStream(""/Netscape/Server4/docs/"" + s + "".gif""); Let me know if I have answered  your questions.|||Werner: Hi Diana, that answers my question, thanks a lot for your help !

Please note that the matrix provides for discounts for a large customer base at every usage level, so that even if they bring us a large number of heavy users which are priced at a higher individual rate, the total customer base benefits as the volume of customers increases.

There are no simulators available today with command line options.  As a result we will have to write our own html browser for the HTML based devices. - Do we use the ICEbrowser for this ? - java based. - easier to integrate - cost (unknown, heard some high estimates, need to confirm) - use ICE browser for simulation and then later replace our IE browser with this as well.  Using ICE browser will make the relative URL java script problem a non issue. - One can use IE for simulation ? - this will require activeX and we will be introducing more C++ dependency. - more work than ICEbrowser If a long term goal is going to be make the EMDS completely java based then we might want to start migrating to ICE browser.

94,"Subject: l-mode support|||Hideki: Hello, Sorry for delayed reply. We tested TMTDW application. When I invesigated the difference between i-MODE and L-MODE based on TAG REFERENCE document, I just found  issue below only. 1. HREF=""FAXTO:number"" This can be achieved using ""passthrough feature"" in current EMAS. 2. H1-6 I would like to check which level of H tag is supported in i-MODE. L-MODE can put up-to level 6, ""H6"". For example, <h4 align=""center"">--</h4> is not working in SP9. 3. Packet size NTT-E recommend to use 5K as maximum. 4. USER-AGENT string. User-Agent:<SP>L-mode//1.0////  where <SP> is half space. In summary, we don't need to touch EMAS/EMDS to support urgently. If possible, we just include MAX_PACKETSIZE parameter and L-Mode User-Agent to be default handling of EPServlet. I would like to discuss this issue tomorrow. Hideki|||Rajeev: Ravi, Can you through some light on the l-mode investigations that are done by Hideki. [As per Hideki all L-mode documentation are in Japanese] *	Where all can one specify the MAX_PACKETSIZE attribute? -ini file, screen, application etc? *	Can you look into the <H> element support in i-mode? *	What do we have to do with User-Agent if  we are to use the existing product, say SP10, to generate L-mode applications? What if we want the EMAS server to host both i-mode and L-mode applications? Rajeev|||Ravi: MAX_PACKETSIZE can be specified at the application level and in the file. Currently <H> is stripped for i-mode but we can add support easily for this. To recognize i-mode devices, we have to modify epservlet code. But this is a small effort. Then we can host both i-mode and L-mode devices using same server.|||Rajeev: Any update on this from the Japan team?",Hideki provides results from a test and notes an issue he would like to discuss with everyone.

Also, Europe and Japan do not have a lot of PS support on site and are in very diff time zones so Sujan is asking about using SE's to do this (for now just in Europe). I've always felt that SE should do whatever it takes to win business. However, doing developer support is more of a post-sales activity. In the case of partners, SE has done some support (e.g. AC in VA).

I thought you meant pre-sales developement work, i.e. building an ""off line"" prototype as part of a sales effort.

Thanks, Ricardo|||Steve: Mike, Did we propose Premium service with dedicated servers to this customer? $4K sounds like Standard. Please confirm. Thanks, Steve|||Steve: Ricardo, Sorry for the delay. How do your hosting agreements specify things like time-out settings and other level of service terms? Settings that vary from application to application are not specified in the hosting agreement. This has more to do with functionality specific to the customer needs rather than a service level maintained for all applications. By default, if the timeout setting is different from any other application, it has to be placed on a standalone server. Five minutes is standard and should not be a problem on a shared server. If and when the customer wants to extend the timeout, the other applications will be considered and either inherit the setting or the app will be moved onto its own server. Because the customer has signed up for Standard service, eventhough the app may be hosted on its own server, the SLA is maintained at 95% for 12X5 coverage.|||Ricardo: Steve, No problem.

At the moment, I think AvocadoIT Respond is installed through InstallShield Pro (Which is regular win apps, and not going to work under solaris). Are we going to support the AvocadoIT Respond installation too ? Or just left as it is today, as regular jar file (which is just a regular zip file). ? Currently we are still testing all the possibilities to have AvocadoIT Respond installable in Solaris too (we will know in 2-3 days).  So far it looks promising. In addition to that if it is possible to have AvocadoIT Respond installer for Solaris platform, we will need some QA extensive resources to test it heavily making sure everything works ok.

146,"Subject: regarding to login failure message bug ... 3863|||Kant: Regarding to bug HTTP://LINK it will works in JDB adapter but it may not work for ActiveX adapter. For ActiveX interface, Siebel will return 4096 for invalid logon and also for other errors that maybe or may not be logon related.  Thus in ActiveX version of the adapter, adapter can't tell from the return code what 4096 really means and thus won't re-map the return code to 407 (map to 500 for generic server error). So if OCA looking for return code 407 then do a special process (correct Siebel return message is in packet level error), it may have different behaviors between ActiveX and JDB ... According to below e-mail, README.TXT already stated that user may experience different behavior between ActiveX and JDB ... just want to we all agree on this. Please also see HTTP://LINK for additional information.|||Rajeev: OCA does special things for 407 [An error code that is defined by the Offline subsystem .. not individual adaptors]. For 407 error OCA is not only displaying the error message returned by OSA/Adaptor But more importantly it is also reseting the Record status from uploaded_modified/inserted to modified/inserted state etc. For other error types the records will be set to Error state....a very painfull thing fo the end device user. I would highly recommend that the ActiveX adaptor put the appropriate hack to return an 407 error in case of login failure. Rajeev|||Keith: We will make ActiveX return 407 based on any exception from the login call. We'll need another build/installer. We'll let you know when. Keith|||Geoff: This has been done. It is worth pointing out that the bug was filed for *all* error messages, not just the login message.  The login message is critical, and has been addressed.  All other messages remain unaccesible from applications. We should fix this after 2/28.|||Sanjay: I agree with Rajeev. You're better off mapping all login failure messages to 407.","Kent explains the solution to the log in failure message bug will work in JDB adapter, but not in ActiveX because of the value the failure returns.

Given that, I'm not too sure what other Fleet work you're involved with (possibly completing documentation for the PDA app). If you have some bandwidth on Tues, do either of you want to undertake writing a PRC file for a Palm application to effectively perform a ""please wait"" function so that the Palm gateway doesn't timeout the session if the customer's website is very slow.

156,"Subject: as 400 support?|||Bradley: Team, I have a potential customer, The Venetian in Las Vegas, who is very serious about going wireless. A budget and timeframe already exists, however they do not want to do any integration work. All of their data and communication resides within their mainframe (IBM AS 400/3270 dumb terminals). This information includes player status, statistics, room status, typical hotel and casino data. They want to deploy a variety of devices within the casino to access the mainframe. Simply put by the customer, if we do not support the AS 400 without any significant integration work than we're out. Would it be possible to build an adaptor specific for this type of traffic? Most casinos and hotels in Las Vegas operate with this infrastructure. Your thoughts and comments would be appreciated. Bradley|||Ricardo: Is the functionality they are looking to mobilize transactional or view only?|||Bradley: Both.  They need to be able to view data on specific players and customers.  Details are limited at this point. I need to know what are limitations are to date.  Regardless of the DB, what would it take for EP to interoperate with an AS400?  Is it possible to build an adaptor specific to this type of architecture?  If not, I need to bring in an SI, or better understand our EAI story.  This deal won't fly with any integration work. Bradley|||Ricardo: Brad, It looks like they need to view information, but no updates to the data store are required. Where the data is stored is independent of the architecture. If the information is stored on a JDBC compliant database, then we should be able to mobilize it through the JDBC connector available in 3.0. If it's stored in a proprietary data store, and a Java interface already exist, then we could mobilize it through the Java API available in 3.0. Else a Java or web-interface  will have to be built in order for us to mobilize it. I hope this helps, Ricardo|||Bradley: That sounds good.  I figured as much, thanks for taking the time this morning, see you tomorrow. Bradley","Bradley says that Venetian is a potential customer, but only if AvocadoIT can help them go wireless without any major integration work.

Upgrade the server software to 2.1.x The version of 2.1 ECS we are running does not support the detailed reporting described in my initial e-mail.

181,"Subject: bus dev|||George: david, just to be real clear. i know their is no disagreement the $12m bus dev commitment is for partner identified business. kraft is a partner deal. abn amro is not a partner deal|||David: George: I'd also like your agreement that where a partner adds significant value to EP closing a deal that we would not normally have gotten, then it should be considered a partner deal, as well.  Disney - identified by Grant, requires significant SI work, brought CGEY into picture because CGEY ""owns"" Disney - looks like a good combo.  In fact, there are going to be a lot of these type of cases.  In addition, I don't think an account is the way we want to count ""deals"", but really opportunities or specific projects within an account.  That's why we specifically put in the Prospect Registration Form.  Within any account, there could be many projects.  I wouldn't want to say categorically for example that ABM Amro is not a partner deal.  FedX is a very good example where Meltzer is working one opp and Accenture is bringing Meltzer into another. David|||George: we have had this conversation before and i still agree. i will pay on a per registered project and not a per client basis. with regard to bus dev helping on deals, that why you all have stock. in the case of close calls i hope you trust/respect me enough to know that i will do the right thing.  best regards  george|||Marie: George, Since Accenture and CGEY are expensive channels for us, I hope we are not involving them or relying on them unless they really are bringing value to opportunities that we can not close on ourselves. Marie|||David: I always trust you George. David|||David: Team: FYI ... I agree with George.  We need to make sure that the partners are bringing significant value to a deal, either by bringing us into the opportunity or, as in the case of USPS, really helping to close the deal.  As shareholders in the company, we certainly don't want to double pay for ""uncertain"" value. It also makes it imperative, that we understand, manage, and track partner opportunities appropriately.  I cannot emphasize this enough. Each of you should be responsible for really managing your partner opportunities.  There are too many instances where ""we"" brought them in, no ""we"" brought THEM in. Again, I'm asking for both Mitch's and Toni's great help in this area: to make sure that the info/projects are clear in Channelwave and the referring party is accurate. Thanks, everyone. David|||Mitch: Agreed,  I also think it is important to look at all opportunities we have and constantly evaluate where we need to engage a partner.  Not bringing them in just to bring them in, but to bring them in to win the business.  This week, we found out that there are projects going on in Sara, Bear Stearns and BofA that evolved independently of any partner introductions, even though partners had taken us in at other points in those companies.  At what point, if any, do we involve the partners in these opportunities?  In two instances (Sara, BofA), when I talked to the AM's they were not even aware we had partner connections in those accounts. I think ChannelWave will help all of you to see where we are engaged and to communicate with the AM to bring in the business. Mitch","George gives David specific examples of which deals should be counted as partner deals (Kraft) and which shouldn't (ABN Amro). David says that if closing a deal gives them access to a project they otherwise couldn't take on, it should count as a partner deal. He also says that pay should be per project, not per partner, and George agrees. Mitch and David both say that new partners should only be taken on if they provide lucrative projects.",David asks George to clarify that the $12m bus dev commitment is for partner identified business and that kraft is not a partner deal

186,"Subject: error messages + log messages|||Srikanth: All I want to clarify our logging + error handling framework. We have two resource bundles (properties) - Logging infrastructure uses StudioLogResource (this is for localizing the log messages) Errors uses DesignStudioErrors ... How do we log errors ? It looks like we log it at the place where we catch the errors try { IdSwitchComponent.createSwitch( dsm.getSelectedLeafNodes() ); } catch (DesignStudioException e) { //? //logger.error(""MODEL_ERROR_LOOP_NOT_CREATED"", null, null, null); } This message is different from the actual error message in the exception.  We should log the original error message too. What if there is a call to logger.error() in the constructor of DesignStudioException in addition to the message where it is caught.  Ideally we want to use the same resourcekey for the logger also, today since the property files are different we have to duplicate the entries. Why can't we have one resource bundle for both log messages & errors ? Srik|||Ritesh: we use Logger to show messages to the user and it always uses message strings defined in StudioLogResource... So all messages shown to the user in message panel should come from StudioLogResource... For Exceptions also if we are defining certain error messages, should come from above resource bundle. We don't need two resource bundle.|||Srikanth: Ok. Unless I hear otherwise I'll consider Ritesh's suggestion as our approach. srik","Srikanth says there are currently two bundles of resources being used to log error messages, StudioLogResources for log messages and DesignStudioErrors for errors. He asks why they can't use a single resource bundle for both to avoid unnecessary duplication. Ritesh says that both processes should use StudioLogResource, and Srikanth agrees to make that the standard approach going forward.",Srikanth asks Ritesh if they need to have two resource bundles for both log messages & errors.

Can we make the shared files within the ECS ad EMAS be in a seperate package or directory? Just a thought.

Perhaps, we can identify people who can code review what modules. If one person from the identified group is not available then a backup person can be contacted. As long as the code is reviewed by anyone from the established authorities. We used to have build file, but that is no longer available. We only have buildonce.

Om|||Steve: I apologize for jumping into the middle of the strand, but what is this? Let me understand what is being said here. Are we saying that we must localize now? I have never seen a requirement that we localize for Europe; only Japan. If this is just requiring that we do it at some point in the future, then fine -- we internationalized so we should be able to localize. But if we are saying that we are going to pay to localize now, I have a big problem with this. I have been told that English is okay for now until we have customers for deployment who demand localization. Please don't start localizing for Europe until I understand that there is a change in requirements that is required for Q1 revenue. Maybe there is a change and I just don't know it. Please let me know. Thanks. \Steve|||Om: Steve, 1. Earlier understanding was: a) Rel 3.0 product will be tested with one European language ( for end device user messages). b) English version is ok for Release 3.0. PM had to still confirm, I was following it up. 2. Lacalizing Online help for Europe is a new requirement. Om|||Rajeev: See embeded comments. Steve, Thanks for jumping in. I agree with you 100%. R&D is still figuring out the date by which time we can deliver Japanese on-line help and documentation [End of April is not commited]. From the market standpoint do we have any sense on the urgency of this requirement [no sale possible without this etc.] so that we can throw appropriate amount of money and people resources on it? Thanks Rajeev|||Glenn: Localization of online help is a new requirement from Europe. This is / was not scheduled for delivery in 3.0 and I am not suggesting we do so, but I think we'll be asked by at least one customer in Europe for this capability before the 3.5 release -- Peter in Germany expects to have a customer in Germany by the end of the quarter or early next quarter. I am more concerned about localization of error messages sent to the device. I was told that these error message strings were being externalized and that there were only five to ten of these messages. If this is true, I can have the folks in Europe translate the messages for us and have them sent back to us for incorporation into the product. Can we do this? Glenn.|||Steve: Okay, so as I understand it, we will not localize for Germany at this time. Om, please check per Rajeev's suggestion to understand the steps necessary to localize error messages to the device and to localize on-line help (two different efforts. If it helps, picture this scenario: we deliver English 3.0 to Europe, and in May or June, they say they want the product localized to German. We need to have a list of those things requiring localization (e.g. not just the things above but EMAS messages, installation, docs, and so forth), an estimated time to complete, and a method to accomplish each. At that point, they may well request a localization of a subset of things and wait for 3.5 to localize completely. Thanks. \Steve|||Steve: Sounds good. Thanks Rajeev. \Steve|||Glenn: I have asked the folks in Europe if they can get the localized, tested resources bundles for the device error messages to us by the 19th. Will let you know what their response is once I receive it. To clarify, are you saying that if they do this we will include it in the 3.0 release and will not have to provide separate patches for the languages they localize for by the 19th? Glenn.","Steve is confused about why they are requiring different localization requirements for certain deadlines. Om explains to Steve the reasoning behind the European localization market. Rajeev jumps in to explain the Japanese localization market, but agrees with Steve about their approach. Glenn also further explains to Steve why it is important they work on European localization for their online help network.

288,"Subject: opt-in feature|||Barbara: Tony, Realized that the opt-in feature isn't part of 6.0.  Will this be phased in before 6.1?  It's actually a very big feature because it allows clients to interact with their customers after they entered a sweepstakes or lead generation.  Since the majority of these customers don't automatically become paying customers an opt-in is their only chance to get permission to follow-up with them. Barbara|||Tony: Barbara, You're right, the bottom line is that it didn't get into 6.0.  There was quite a bit of groundwork done, but the feature wasn't exposed.  What happened was that it was implemented according to the original MRD, which called for the options to be mandatory & not editable, and then Sales & Client Services said it was essential to make them optional & editable.  That turned out not to be easy, and at the end of the day the feature was disabled. This feature can definitely be turned on for 6.1 -- the estimate is 1-2 days.  However, it's not on the plate now, and adding it will require either pushing something else off or slipping a bit.  I take it from your message that this is a priority.  Should we do this for 6.1, even if that means a slip? Tony|||Barbara: Tony, I know that we only had two weeks to complete the 6.1 items.  I never saw the final list for 6.1 that was agreed upon by engineering and Client Services.  I can't make the call to slip the date because it was based on client needs. The opt-in feature is definitely important, but if we haven't brought up this feature to our clients then they may not be aware this was an option.  Anytime we or our clients collect customer information we should always ask permission to communicate further. Barbara|||Marcia: This is my fault for specifying the feature one way and then, upon reflection and with additional feedback from clients, changing my input. Barbara you are doing a fabulous job of evangalizing best practices.  Even so, we need to get 6.0 fixed before we can have the engineering team move on to new features in 6.0.

Jup is pretty bullish on sending images for entertainment purposes - not productivity. They look to Japan, where Bandai had 1.6MM subs by last summer (this is the second most popular individual app in Japan according to one source).  They believe this market will be like that for the Polaroid - quick and dirty is okay, I want it now. Jup does NOT believe video will be a big market anytime soon - too bandwidth intensive (think about it - you could put 4 calls on same bandwidth as one streamed video) One more data point for prioritizing the roadmap|||Toshiya: Bandai makes roughly $1 per subscriber per month off this application (Approximately $20 million per year!). Bandai is spinning this division off soon. Image handling is much more rich in Japan thanks to the handset capabilities. I agree that many of the applications for images will be entertainment driven. Many guys like Photonet are supplying services to consumers for uploading personal images (family photos etc.) to their handsets. I general, though, even in the business application area, imaging is more important than here in the US since cHTML can handle color images and many content providers take advantage of that to differenciate their services. The Java enabled handsets coming out in mid December will intially target the entertainment market and manipulating images is a large part of that.

It will help me to resolve future conflicts without having to ask about them each time. Klee|||Nihar: Klee, Thanks for the reminder. From what I understand: operations use Production.ini for ECS and Std.ini for EPServlet. EPServlet CAN use Production.ini - you need to set CONFIG_PATH parameter in web server (ex. Netscape) configuration file. Ravi is the contact person to get exact information on this. If CONFIG_PATH is not specified, EPServlet defaults to d:PATH\std.ini. Q is: Do we document 'How to configure EPServlet?' in any of our manuals ?? If yes, we need to make sure that infomation about CONFIG_PATH setting is covered and we can remove reference to std.ini. Also we need to document that - if the web server you are using is 'ServletRunner' (this should happen only in development environment) - there is no way to set CONFIG_PATH i.e. std.ini will be used.

373,"Subject: supporting tomcat|||Ravi: We had a meeting (Srikanth, Myself and other EMAS/EMDS engineers) today to decide on the server's role in supporting preview functionality in EMDS. We all came to the conclusion that it is better to run the server locally to do preview. Following are the main reasons why a server needs to run locally - Few(No) changes in server code - Minimal changes in EMDS (i assume) - better response time as the request doesn't have to go over the network. The consequences of the above decision is that: - EMAS needs to be installed along with EMDS - A free JSP engine needs to be shipped along with each EMDS copy. - More testing effort that affects QA schedule because originally we decided to support only weblogic. Please let us know what you think. Ravi|||Prakash: Isn't our whole  development and license model change with this?Are we saying we bundle Tomcat? Prakash|||Ravi: Yes! This means we need to bundle Tomcat. The question is, is this acceptable? If not, we need to find alternative solutions to preview functionality. Ravi|||Prakash: Amitabh, Please take it all the way through. I would have prefred a different way with only the designer in the act. If it is not doable within the timeframe minimize the schedule impact. Toronto folks have done Tomcat bundling as part of RC. We may be able to leverage that. Prakash|||Srikanth: Amitabh We need to resolve this issue for ""simulation"" in general, unless we mandate that simulation will require a ""save + deploy"" before being able to simulate. Thanks Srik","The decision is being made to run the server locally supporting preview functionality in EMDS.  The benefit of this approach include minimal changes to the server code, minimal changes in EMDS, and better response time.  This decision requires a change in the plan and bundling of Tomcat, EMAS installation along with EMDS, shipping a free JPS engine with each EMDS copy.  This change may impact schedule and is something to address.",Ravi and Prakash have a meeting to decide on the server's role in supporting preview functionality in EMDS.

Was not certain what your plan was for this server so I did not go any further configuration-wise with him. Anyway you have full control over the box. Once you are done, we need to get the Outlook clients tested so that we can complete phase 1. Thanks, Steven|||Craig: what is the plan tho?  do they have their own domain or do they plan to be a slave to ours?  do they need their own internal machines setup on our dns with .avocadoit.com suffixes?  he won't be able to ping the internal dns since the return route isn't in the routing table on the internal dns server. I guess my question would be, what is the intent and purpose of their dns server.  they'll be using our wins server for NT name resolution.  the dns would only be for non-NT resolution. Craig|||Steve: Sorry, I thought that by asking Sitraka to set up a DNS server, there was some plan behind it...apparently not. From what I know, they do not have their own domain so it is EP's decision as to the necessity of a DNS server (faster for them? Whatever.). If they do not require an internal DNS server, they can already get to the WINS server. So, if that is all they need, then proceed with testing the Outlook client unless there is something else keeping us from doing that! Steve|||Craig: the only time dns came up is when I asked if they had one.  Then the conclusion was that they could point to their own isp's dns to get name resolution for the outside world (forwarders). As for internal dns, if they need one to authenticate or lookup internal dns names, that's fine.  I'll make it a slave of our internal dns server and do the needfull by updating our end and it'll propogate downstream any changes made....  Then I could add their machines that they want in the dns and be done with it.

Since we don't have enough paying clients right now we are going to postpone this program until November.

If not, here is another copy with updated copy. We have had some technical issues with Goldmine and getting the right filters put in place to download the accounts by their qualification.  However, Mark has been very proactive with Tom and we hope to have everything settled by end of today.",Barbara sends Marcia a referral program idea for review and requests input on the referral details.

Thanks, Ricardo|||Ron: Ricardo and PM Team, A few thoughts: 1) We only show a connection to a web server (hosted) or intranet server (license) on the back end. I think this is NOT in our best interest; rather, let's show ability to connect to multitude of sources or simply label back-end source with a generic term (customer back-end systems) 2)Related to 1) above, we only show info coming in as HTML or XML. While I understand that the generic Java API will basically take data in as HTML, do we really want to raise this question from customers.  Similarly, with a JDBC call to a remote DB, while the request looks like an URL, is the output format HTML? 3) Any way to include voice?|||Ricardo: Ron, Regarding 1) I think that it would be a good idea to label the secure web server box to Customer Front-End or Back-End System. In the case of 2) I can add a table and an object icon to represent the interaction with databases and the interaction with remote objects that interact with other data sources. On the other hand, I wanted these diagrams to remain as simple as possible in order to convey a message focused on how we handle security. I think that it would be good idea to prepare another diagram to show the capabilities you have identified. Rick|||Ron: I think its a mistake to try to be simple but then put labels that confirm views of us as a screen scraper. You never know where these docs end up; even internally when you are not there to explain them to the CIO whose underlying forwards it to him as part of package to convince him why to meet with us.|||Ricardo: Understood.

Prakash|||Steve: Prakash, Here is what we will be doing to accomodate this request. 1. There is ONE spare Dell 6350 server that Nadir will attempt to clone. If we cannot use this server for some reason, there are no other servers available until the ASP side is moved out of the corporate office. 2. Move the ASP services out (1.5 weeks). This will yield a few spares that can be used for cloning. 3. If the move time is insufficient, we can always load a new server with a clean operating system. However, I know that the reason for the cloning is due to the fact that it will take a good amount of Richard's time to configure it. We project cloning and setup to be 2 days minimum.

Thanks for following up, Doug|||Jaigak: Doug, Although I'm not the best person to answer your question, I'd like to try as nobody answers yet. Yuyu, if I'm wrong, please correct me. The device type is identified by looking at HTTP header information when a HTTP request comes. One of useful headers is ""USER-AGENT"". USER-AGENT usually contains device model information and browser information. Sometimes gateway information, too. So if the device or the browser is known to us, we can decide the exact device type. For example, a USER-AGENT from a Siemens Phone looks like: User-Agent: SIE-C3I/1.0 UP/4.1.8c UP.Browser/4.1.8c-XXXX UP.Link/4.2. Here SIE-C3I is device model information and UP.Browser/4.1 is browser information. If device information is unknown, another HTTP header ""ACCEPT"" will be used. ""ACCEPT"" specifies acceptable markup languages (or appliations). For example, if ""ACCEPT"" has application/vnd.wap.wmlc, the device type can be WML device.

Did this issue come up before during development or design?  I tried the search function which displays the results, but does not let you click on the name to get the details. This might have been planned (customer request, technical limitations, etc.), but I was curious (maybe this was an item when Mehrak was handling the project).  If it is possible, I would think it would be useful to have the company names as hyperlinks on search results.  Any thoughts? Thanks. Darshan|||Narasing: Darsan, You are right, that would be useful if comany names have links in search results page. Since this search logic is very tedious and complex it would take very significant effort to add links in the serch page. Any how we are assessing the requird efforts and I will keep you update on this. Thanks Rao|||Narasing: Darsan, Tapaswi, the corresponding AE for this xSellsys project assessed the effort required to add hyper link to company name in search results page.

It may  need 1.5 days to fix this including testing. We will complete it by COB (Wednesday IDC). I will keep you update with the status. Thanks Rao|||Darshan: Please wait before deploying this feature into production as we should talk to the customer before making production updates.  Do you expect the implementation of this to cause any performance issues with the application (data transfer sizes or longer processing time on EMAS)? Maybe this can initially get deployed on the test server first to test with real devices.  I think this will be an important feature to make usage easier. Thanks.

Please note that, we will deploy these files into production only after, you confirm it with the customer. Thanks, Tapaswi|||Darshan: That sounds great. We'll test them today. Thanks. Darshan|||Darshan: I tested it and I think it works great.  What do you think?  Should we go ahead and deploy this into production or ask/tell the customer? As I'm surprised that this has not already come up before (DDS or no DDS requirement), if we implement it without telling them it could avoid having to further customize the feature.  They may ask about making all search results hyperlinks which we certainly don't want to do for free.  It's also good to avoid any discussions about what was in or not in the original requirements. I'm interested to see what thoughts you have on the choice we have. Thanks. Darshan|||Narasing: Darsan, We put 30 man hours to add this feature, including the efforts development, testing and management. I go with you on this decision, that we deploy this feature first, then we can explain the customer to pay for the effort.

Please let me know when can we do this. vinayak|||Steve: Word of caution. From your comments below, you will be dialing out of this connection and establishing a ""trusted"" tunnel to our network. Please ensure that the test machine (especially if it has server OS) is not already terminated into our local LAN to avoid any possible routing loops when performing this test. Failure to do so may produce faulty results (because you are routing to the Ethernet interface) or the Extranet switch may get confused having two routes to the same machine. The latter should not occur if you are obtaining the addresses from the Extranet switch however, the workstation should be removed from the LAN to be certain.|||Vinayak: I will remove my LAN connection while testing. regards, vinayak|||Vinayak: Nadir, OS on My desktop is Windows NT 4.0.

I wanted to find out from you about the status of a production server for the USPS application. Can you please update me with the status so that I can plan accordingly. Thanks, Rishi|||Steve: Rishi, Thanks. We have sufficient servers for USPS. Preferred platform is Solaris. Steve|||Rishi: Should we plan on migrating USPS to 3.0 GA Solaris ? It was developed on 2.5 beta refresh 2 (NT). I'll clarify that with Steve in my next email but just wanted to get your thoughts. -Rishi|||Rishi: Steve, The USPS server would need to be setup with 2.5.054 NT since the USPS applications were completed, tested and accepted on that platform. Changing the build environment at this time would be difficult and time-consuming. -Rishi|||Steve: Rishi, I can appreciate the effort to keep the OS platform consistent. There are a limited number of NT servers available at QWEST and Exodus although I don't see a problem with hosting USPS. Migrating all servers to UUNET does mean that if we place USPS onto an NT platform, it will need to be migrated. This should be transparent to the customer as there are no changes to the URL. Do you have a live date for the customer yet? Steve|||Rishi: Darshan, Any updates on when the USPS hosting agreement would be signed? Rishi|||Darshan: No new information.  Can you send Tony an email to see if he can give you a status/estimate of when it will be signed?  I'll let you know if I hear any updates. dp|||Rishi: Steve, The customer would like to go live by May 4th (next Friday). However, that date is contingent upon the hosting agreement being signed within the next couple of days. The account manager for this project (Anthony) needs to find out how much lead time we need to get the USPS applications working on a production server (so that he can set the right expectations with the customer). What is your estimate from an operations standpoint? I will add AE time on top of your estimate. Thanks, Rishi|||Steve: Rishi, Give us 72 hours and we'll be fine. Thanks, Steve",Rishi is asking for a status update on the USPS application. Steve replied that there should be no issue hosting USPS on a Solaris server. Rishi expressed concerns about the server build number not matching. Steve replied that there should be no issue with hosting USPS on a different server and there should be no downstream impact to the customer. Rishi asked again for a status update; there has been no new developments.  Customer would like to proceed on May 4th but is dependent on getting the agreement signed.,Rishi tells Steve that the USPS hosting agreement is coming close to being signed and wants to know about the status of a production server for the USPS application.

Thanks Praveen|||Wilhan: Hi Praveen, The examples folder is under installbuild (d:PATH\examples), and you should get it recursively.  About where it is suppose to be installed, I myself not too sure, since it was not mentioned.  Nihar will probably has better idea. Thanks, Wilhan|||Rajeev: Nihar, Tony, Nihiar can you resolve this along with Tony. There are now a few examples that we will ship with. {AvocadoIT  Install Dir}/Samples/<Sample name>/files would be ideal. However I do not know whether the sample apps will work if they are installed in such a directory structure. Rajeev|||Praveen: Rajeev, I think sampleapp will work in this structure also , because the end user manuall run the PopulateDB.bat file to upload this application to the Database and at that time running this PopulateDB he will give this directory structure. But the thing is willhan need to write some script so that sampleapp will move to this structure with the InstallBuild. There was one bug opened today with PopulateDb HTTP://LINK i created  sampleapp using build 3.0 , and i found that in EMDS when u save the project it is not generating the AML page in the ImodeAml folder. Is this a bug? or expected behaviour.  Note that DesignerNT.bat is pointing to JRE1.2 Thanks Praveen|||Tony: Please see my comments below. Thanks -Tony|||Wilhan: All, I am still not sure what is the finality is, so why dont we just wait for Tony and Nihar to finalize the structure tomorrow before I cut the CD. To summarize (so far) I think there are a couple of the issues: 1. examples directory (currently planned in the d:\installbuild\examples)  but where it should be put after the install ? 2. sampleApp directory (currently in the d:PATH\sampleApp) --  This one is the old one, shipped with previous 2.5, and installed into [Install_Location]:\sampleApp folder. Thanks, Wilhan",There are examples that need to be provded to Wilhan so he can create a CD.  There is some discussion about which examples should be included and where they should be saved to.  The AML page is not being generated upon save and this is viewed as a possible bug.
